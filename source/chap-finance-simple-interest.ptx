  <introduction>
    <p>
      It costs to borrow money.  The "rent" one pays for the use of money is called the <term>interest</term>. The amount of money that is being borrowed or loaned is called the <term>interest</term> or <term>present value</term>.

    <title>Simple Interest</title>
    <p>
      Simple interest is interest paid only on the original amount borrowed.  In this scenario, the borrower pays a fixed interest rate on the principal for the entire time the money is held.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculating interest starts with the <term>principal</term>, <em>P</em>, or the beginning amount in your account. This is also called the <term>present value</term>. This could be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan. The <term>interest rate</term>, <em>I</em>, in its most simple form, is a percentage of the principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100. It is important to remember to change the interest <term>rate</term>, r, of 5% into a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left before performing any calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>(0.05)(\$100)=\$5</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The total amount you would repay is called the <term>future value</term> and would be $105, the original principal plus the interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>\$100+\$5=\$105</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      One-time simple interest as in the above example is only common for extremely short-term or informal loans. For longer term loans or investments, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. 
      In that case, interest would be earned regularly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To see how this works, supposed you borrow $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest per year, and you keep the money for 3 years. 
      How much would you need to repay at the end of the loan? The amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100 each year for three years, that is    
    </p>
    <p>
      <me> (0.05)(\$100)(3) = \$15. </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The future value of the loan would be $115, which is the original plus the interest.
    </p>
        <p>
      <me>\$100+\$15=\$115</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      These ideas are summarize in the block below.

      Bonds are an example of a simple investment with a regular interest payout. Bonds are issued by the federal, state or local governments to cover their expenses.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it. You buy a $1,000 bond that pays 5% simple interest annually and matures in 5 years. How much interest will you earn? What is the future value of the bond?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Each year, you would earn 5% interest so over the course of five years, you would earn:
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>\$1000(0.05)(5)=\$250</me>
        </p>

        <p>
          When the bond matures, you would receive back the $1,000 you originally paid and the $250 in interest, so we could also put that into a single calculation:
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>\$1000+\$1000(0.05)(5)=\$1250</me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Here are a couple more examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Ursula borrows $600 for 5 months at a simple interest rate of 15% per year.  Find the interest, and the total amount she is obligated to pay.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The interest is computed by multiplying the principal with the interest rate and the time.

          <me>
            I = \$600(.15)\left(\frac{5}{12}\right) = \$37.50.
          </me>
          Note that here the rate has units of years and the time has units of month so we convert 5 months into years by dividing by 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          The total amount is thus
        </p>
        <p>
          <me> A = P + I = \$600 + \$37.50 = \$637.50.</me>
          This total can be computed directly using
          <md>
            <mrow> A =\amp P(1+rt) </mrow>
            <mrow> =\amp \$600[1+(.15)(5/12)] </mrow>
            <mrow> =\amp \$600(1+0.0625)</mrow>
            <mrow> =\amp \$637.50. </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Darnel owes a total of $3060 which includes 12% interest for the three years he borrowed the money.  How much did he originally borrow? 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This time we are asked to find the principal <me>P</me> given the future value.
          <md>
            <mrow>\$3060 =\amp P[1+(.12)(3)] </mrow>
            <mrow>\$3060 =\amp P(1.36)</mrow>
            <mrow> \frac{\$3060}{1.36} =\amp P </mrow>
            <mrow> \$2250 =\amp P </mrow>
          </md>
          Darnel originally borrowed $2250.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
