  <introduction>
    <p>
      It costs to borrow money.  The "rent" one pays for the use of money is called the <term>interest</term>. The amount of money that is being borrowed or loaned is called the <term>interest</term> or <term>present value</term>.

    <title>Simple Interest</title>
    <p>
      Simple interest is interest paid only on the original amount borrowed.  In this scenario, the borrower pays a fixed interest rate on the principal for the entire time the money is held.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculating interest starts with the <term>principal</term>, <em>P</em>, or the beginning amount in your account. This is also called the <term>present value</term>. This could be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan. The <term>interest rate</term>, <em>I</em>, in its most simple form, is a percentage of the principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100. It is important to remember to change the interest <term>rate</term>, r, of 5% into a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left before performing any calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>(0.05)(\$100)=\$5</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The total amount you would repay is called the <term>future value</term> and would be $105, the original principal plus the interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>\$100+\$5=\$105</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      One-time simple interest as in the above example is only common for extremely short-term or informal loans. For longer term loans or investments, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. 
      In that case, interest would be earned regularly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To see how this works, supposed you borrow $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest per year, and you keep the money for 3 years. 
      How much would you need to repay at the end of the loan? The amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100 each year for three years, that is    
    </p>
    <p>
      <me> (0.05)(\$100)(3) = \$15. </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The future value of the loan would be $115, which is the original plus the interest.
    </p>
        <p>
      <me>\$100+\$15=\$115</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      These ideas are summarize in the block below.

      Bonds are an example of a simple investment with a regular interest payout. Bonds are issued by the federal, state or local governments to cover their expenses.
    </p>
    <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it. You buy a $1,000 bond that pays 5% simple interest annually and matures in 5 years. How much interest will you earn? What is the future value of the bond?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Each year, you would earn 5% interest so over the course of five years, you would earn:
          </p>
          <p>
            <me>\$1000(0.05)(5)=\$250</me>
          </p>

          <p>
            When the bond matures, you would receive back the $1,000 you originally paid and the $250 in interest, so we could also put that into a single calculation:
          </p>
          <p>
            <me>\$1000+\$1000(0.05)(5)=\$1250</me>
          </p>
        </solution>
    </example>
