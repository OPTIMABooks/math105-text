	<introduction>
		<p>
			In the previous section, we explored how calculating probabilities can become more complex when dealing with multiple events. In this section, we turn our attention to how the probability of an event can change when additional information is known. Sometimes, we calculate the probability of an event based solely on the overall sample space. Other times, we calculate the probability of an event given that another event has already occurred. Understanding which approach to use is essential for analyzing dependent and independent events.

		<p>
			Sometimes knowledge about one event can change the probability of another event. When knowledge about one event happening or not happening changes the probability of another event happening, the events are called <term>dependent</term>. When knowledge about one event makes no difference in the probability of another event happening, the events are called <term>independent</term>.

			<idx><h>probability</h><h>independence</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Two events, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, are called <term>independent</term> if the occurrence of <m>A</m> has no influence on the probability of <m>B</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			Coin flips and die rolls are common examples of independent events <mdash/> flipping heads does not change the probability of flipping heads the next time, nor does rolling a six change the probability that the next roll will be a six. Here is another example illustrating the difference between independent and dependent events.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						The events <q>it is raining in New York City</q> and <q>there is a traffic jam in Los Angeles</q> are <alert>independent</alert>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The events <q>it is raining in New York City</q> and <q>there is a traffic jam in New York City</q> could be <alert>dependent</alert>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			Why might rain and a traffic jam be <em>dependent</em>? Because heavy rain can make driving more difficult, increasing the likelihood of slowdowns or accidents that lead to traffic jams! The following example gives more illustrations of dependent and independent events.

			<!-- <title>Determining if Events are Independent or Dependent</title> -->

			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					<ol marker="a.">
						<li>
							<p>
								Does knowing if the first flip was a heads or tails change the probability that the third flip will be a heads? Coins do not have memories. Anything we know about the first flip has no effect on what happens on the second flip, so <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>independent</term>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								This experiment is different from the previous one. Knowing that the first flip came up a heads does have an effect on whether all three flips come up heads. After all, if <m>A</m> did not happen, then <m>B</m> can not possibly happen either. Therefore, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>dependent</term>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Since we are replacing the marbles after we draw them, the probability of getting a red on the first draw and on the second draw are the same: <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>. What happens on the first draw does not effect the probability of getting a red on the second draw. Because of this, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>independent</term>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								In our final question, we are again drawing marbles, but this time what happens on the first draw does make a difference. Since we do not replace the marbles we draw, if <m>A</m> does not happen (we draw red), there are two marbles left: 1 red and 1 white. So <m>P(B) = \frac{1}{2}</m>. However, if <m>A</m> does happen (we draw a white), then there are two marbles left, both of which are red. So <m>P(B) = 0</m>. Since <m>P(B)</m> changes depending on whether <m>A</m> happens or not, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <term>dependent</term>.

		<title>Conditional Probability</title>
		<p>
			As we saw above, the probability of one event can change depending on the occurrence of another. Because these probabilities can be different, we need a way to denote the probability of one event given than another has occurred. This is called the <term>conditional probability</term> of the first event, given that the second event happens. The formal definition is given below.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_conditional-probability">
			<idx>conditional probability</idx>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>conditional</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>conditional probability</term> of <m>A</m> given <m>B</m> is the probability of event <m>A</m> given that event <m>B</m> has occurred. Symbolically, this is written as <m>P(A\mid B)</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			We read <m>P(A\mid B)</m> as <q>the probability of <m>A</m> given <m>B</m>.</q> This simply means the probability of <m>A</m> with the extra information that <m>B</m> has happened. In <xref ref="ex_conditional_independent-or-dependent"/> we saw several pairs <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> of events for which having the information that <m>B</m> happened changed the probability of <m>A</m>. These dependent events provide good examples for computing conditional probabilities.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_conditional_compute">
			<title>Computing Conditional Probabilities from Outcomes</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A coin is flipped three times. Events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are defined as follows.
					<ul cols="2">
						<li><p><m>A</m>: the first flip is a heads</p></li>
						<li><p><m>B</m>: all three flips are heads</p></li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Find the sample space for this experiment, the outcomes in <m>A</m>, and the outcomes in <m>B</m>. Use this information to find <m>P(A)</m> and <m>P(A\mid B)</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Since the experiment involves flipping a coin three times, a sample outcome would be <m>HHT</m>, representing the first flip coming up heads, the second heads, and the last tails. The set of all outcomes is therefore:
					<me>
						S = \lbrace HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT \rbrace
					</me>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first event of interest, <m>A</m>, consists of all of the outcomes above resulting in a heads on the first flip. This is:
					<me>
						A = \lbrace HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT \rbrace
					</me>.
					We can therefore conclude that
					<me>
						P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.50
					</me>.
				</p>
				<p>
					But what about <m>B</m>? The event <m>B</m> is:
					<me>
						B = \lbrace HHH \rbrace
					</me>.
					If we know that <m>B</m> has happened, then we automatically know that <m>A</m> has happened as well.  This is because if all three flips are heads, the first one must have been a heads (<m>B</m> is a subset of <m>A</m>). Therefore, 
					<me>
						P(A\mid B) = 1
					</me>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that <m>P(A\mid B)</m> and <m>P(A)</m> are different! This is equivalent to saying that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are dependent

		<title>Tree Diagrams and Probability</title>
		<p>
			In a previous section, <xref ref="def_tree-diagram" text="custom">tree diagrams</xref> were useful when working with multi-stage experiments. Since the multiplication rule naturally fits experiments that can be broken up into stages (first <m>A</m> happens, then <m>B</m>, etc.) it makes sense to look into using a tree diagram again. In fact, doing so provides a useful visualization of conditional probability.  This utility is illustrated in the following example.

			<!-- <title>Computing Probabilities with a Tree Diagram</title> -->

					An jar contains six marbles: 3 blue marbles, 2 red marbles, and 1 white marble. Two marbles are drawn, one after the other, without replacement and their colors are noted.

								A tree with three branches off of the start.  Branch B has a probability 3/6, branch R has a probability 2/6, and branch W has a probability 1/6.  Of of branch B, there are three branches: B with probability 2/5, R with probability 2/5, and W with probability 1/5.  Off of the initial branch R, there are also three branches: B with probability 3/5, R with probably 1/5, and W with probability 1/5.  Finally, off of the original branch W there are just two branches: B with probability 3/5 and W with probability 2/5.

					Using this tree diagram, we find the desired probabilities:
					<ol marker="a.">
						<li>
							<p>
								Note that <m>P(\text{2nd }W\mid\text{1st }R)</m> can be read right off the tree. Since we are given that the first marble was red, we go across that middle <m>R</m> branch. Now, the probability the second is white is the probability on the <m>W</m> branch, so <m>\frac{1}{5}</m>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								There are two ways the 2nd marble can be white. If the 1st is red or if the 1st is blue. These are distinct (<xref ref="def_mutually-exclusive" text="custom">mutually exclusive</xref>) paths through the tree. The probability of each is found by multiplying down the branches.  Together, their probability is the sum of these two products, giving us:
								<md>
									<mrow>P(\text{2nd }W) \amp = P(\text{1st }R\cap \text{2nd }W) + P(\text{1st }B\cap \text{2nd }W)</mrow>
									<mrow>\amp = \left(\frac{2}{6}\times \frac{1}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{3}{6}\times \frac{1}{5}\right)</mrow>
									<mrow>\amp = \frac{2}{30} + \frac{3}{30}</mrow>
									<mrow>\amp = \frac{1}{6}</mrow>
								</md>.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			Note that the probabilities on the branches of a tree diagram are conditional probabilities. In the example above, the <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> on the bottom branch from <m>W</m> to <m>R</m> is actually <m>P(\text{2nd }R\mid\text{1st }W)</m> because it connects the event <q>1st <m>W</m></q> to the event <q>2nd <m>R</m>.</q> The general multiplication rule is then used to find the probability of any path through the tree.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Probability both red: <m>\frac{2}{6}\times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{2}{30}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Probability the first is red and the second blue: <m>\frac{2}{6}\times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{6}{30}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Etc...
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, as in the second question in our example, we can find the probability of events such as <q>the second is red</q> by adding together all the different probabilities for paths in which the second marble is red. The following example utilizes these principles and demonstrates an additional advantage of a tree diagram.
