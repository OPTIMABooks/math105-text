	<introduction>
		<p>
			Sets, counting, and probability are fundamental concepts in mathematics that are deeply interconnected. Sets provide a structured way to group objects, forming the basis for understanding collections and relationships. Counting techniques, such as permutations and combinations, allow us to determine the number of ways elements can be arranged or selected from sets. 
      Probability builds on these principles by quantifying the likelihood of events occurring within a given set. Taken together, these topics form a cohesive framework for analyzing and predicting outcomes in various scenarios, from simple games to complex scientific experiments.
