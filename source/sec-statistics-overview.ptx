		<title>Introduction to Statistics</title>
		<p>
			We are constantly exposed to information and statistics. Without the ability to separate credible data from misleading claims, we risk being misled and making poor decisions. Statistics equips us with the tools to think critically and make informed choices, making it an essential subject to study.
		</p>
		<p>
			Statistics are often used to lend credibility to arguments. Consider the following examples (Note: I am not suggesting these statements are true!):
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne chewing gum.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Condoms are effective 94% of the time.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				These claims are all statistical in nature. Some may sound familiar<mdash/>and if not, you have likely encountered similar ones. The examples span a wide range of fields: psychology, health, law, sports, business, and more. Clearly, data and its interpretation permeate nearly every aspect of modern life. However, many of these numbers do not represent careful statistical analysis and can be misleading, pushing you into decisions you might regret. This chapter will help you develop the skills to be a critical consumer of statistical claims.

		<title>Populations and samples</title>
		<p>
			Before we begin gathering any data to analyze, we need to identify the population we are studying. The population of a study is the group we want to know something about. The <term>population</term> could be people, auto parts or tomato plants.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we want to know the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical college student, our population might be all students at Walla Walla University. Or it might be:
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						All college students in the state of Washington.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						All freshman at private colleges in Oregon and Washington.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						All students at colleges and universities in west coast states.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						All students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						And so on.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			The intended population is sometimes called the <term>target population</term>, since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_population">

			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>population</term> of a study is the complete group the collected data is intended to describe.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article. What is the population?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			A <term>parameter</term> is a value (such as a percentage, average, or other measure) that describes a characteristic of an entire population. Since collecting data from every member of a population is often too time-consuming, expensive, or impossible, parameters are usually theoretical quantities that we aim to estimate. For example, the average amount of money spent on textbooks per year by all students Walla Walla University is a parameter.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_parameter">
			<idx>parameter</idx>
			<statement>
				<p>A measurement describing some characteristic of a population is called a <term>parameter</term>.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			To estimate the parameter, we select a <term>sample</term>, which is a smaller subset of the entire population. It is very important that we choose a <term>representative sample</term>, one that matches the characteristics of the population, to have a good estimate. If we survey 100 students at WWU, those students would be our sample. We will talk about how to choose a representative sample later in this section.

			<idx>sample</idx>
			<statement>
				<p>A <term>sample</term> is a sub-collection of subjects drawn from a given population.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			To get our <term>data</term>, we would then ask each student in the sample how much they spent on textbooks and record the answers, or <alert>raw data</alert>. Then we could calculate the average, which is our statistic. A <alert>statistic</alert> is a descriptive value calculated using data from a sample.

					A researcher wants to know how the citizens of Walla Walla feel about a voter initiative. To study this, they go downtown to Land Title Plaza and survey 500 pedestrians. Sixty percent indicate they are supportive of the initiative. Identify the population, parameter, sample and statistic. 
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					<em>Population</em>: While the intended population of this survey is Walla Walla citizens, the effective population is anyone walking through Land Title Plaza. There is no reason to assume that these pedestrians are representative of all Walla Walla citizens. (In fact, many are probably out of town visitors!)
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Parameter</em>: The parameter is what we want to know about the population, in this case the percentage of Walla Walla citizens who support the initiative.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Sample</em>: The sample is the subgroup of the population selected. The 500 pedestrians questioned make up the sample, which, again, is probably not representative of the population.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Statistic</em>: The statistic is calculated using the data from the sample. The percentage of people sampled who support the initiative is 60%.

		<title>Sampling</title>
		<p>
			Before conducting any survey, we need to clearly identify our target population. Let's say a politician hires you to gauge their support for a potential reelection campaign. Who exactly should you survey?
		</p>
		<p>
			The obvious answer might be <q>everyone in the district,</q> but that's not very practical. Eligible voters would be better, but what about those who haven't registered yet? Even registered voters don't always show up on election day. This is why many pollsters focus on <q>likely voters</q> instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Defining a <q>likely voter</q> isn't straightforward, however, and the challenges don't end there. The following example highlights some of the difficulties that arise in political polling.
		</p>
		<example>
			<p>
				In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse <q>The Body</q> Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.
						</p>
					</li> 
					<li>
						<p>
							Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				That said, one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to <term>sampling bias</term>: they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.
			</p>
		</example>
		<p>
			Identifying the population can be tricky, but once we know who we're studying, how do we choose a good sample? We want our sample statistic to accurately estimate the population parameter, which means we need a representative sample. Going back to our political polling example: we wouldn't expect accurate results if we only surveyed Starbucks customers or your TikTok followers<mdash/>groups might not reflect the broader voting population. So how can we select a sample that truly reflects the characteristics of our population?

	<title>Sampling Methods</title>	
	<introduction>
		<p>
			Since it's important to select a sample that accurately represents the population we're studying, we must be careful in how we choose it. This means not only avoiding samples that fail to reflect the population but also guarding against unintentional bias in the way data is collected. To ensure a representative sample, the selection process must be truly random. However, there are several ways to achieve randomness. In this section, we'll explore four methods of random sampling, along with one method that falls short of being random.
