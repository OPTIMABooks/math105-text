	<title>Introduction to Statistics</title>
	<p>
		We are constantly exposed to information and statistics. Without the ability to separate credible data from misleading claims, we risk being misled and making poor decisions. Statistics equips us with the tools to think critically and make informed choices, making it an essential subject to study.

		Statistics are often used to lend credibility to arguments. Consider the following examples (Note: I am not suggesting these statements are true!):
		 	<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne chewing gum.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Condoms are effective 94% of the time.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
					</p>
				</li>
		 	</ul>
		 </p>

			These claims are all statistical in nature. Some may sound familiar<mdash/>and if not, you have likely encountered similar ones. The examples span a wide range of fields: psychology, health, law, sports, business, and more. Clearly, data and its interpretation permeate nearly every aspect of modern life. However, many of these numbers do not represent careful statistical analysis and can be misleading, pushing you into decisions you might regret. This chapter will help you develop the skills to be a critical consumer of statistical claims.
