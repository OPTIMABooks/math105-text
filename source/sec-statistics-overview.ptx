		<title>Introduction to Statistics</title>
		<p>
			We are constantly exposed to information and statistics. Without the ability to separate credible data from misleading claims, we risk being misled and making poor decisions. Statistics equips us with the tools to think critically and make informed choices, making it an essential subject to study.
		</p>
		<p>
			Statistics are often used to lend credibility to arguments. Consider the following examples (Note: I am not suggesting these statements are true!):
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne chewing gum.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Condoms are effective 94% of the time.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				These claims are all statistical in nature. Some may sound familiar<mdash/>and if not, you have likely encountered similar ones. The examples span a wide range of fields: psychology, health, law, sports, business, and more. Clearly, data and its interpretation permeate nearly every aspect of modern life. However, many of these numbers do not represent careful statistical analysis and can be misleading, pushing you into decisions you might regret. This chapter will help you develop the skills to be a critical consumer of statistical claims.

		<title>Populations and samples</title>
		<p>
			Before we begin gathering any data to analyze, we need to identify the population we are studying. The population of a study is the group we want to know something about. The <term>population</term> could be people, auto parts or tomato plants.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we want to know the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical college student, our population might be all students at Walla Walla University. Or it might be:
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						All college students in the state of Washington.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						All freshman at private colleges in Oregon and Washington.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						All students at colleges and universities in west coast states.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						All students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						And so on.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			The intended population is sometimes called the <term>target population</term>, since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_population">
			<idx><h>population</h></idx>
			<idx><h>statistics</h><h>population</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>population</term> of a study is the complete group the collected data is intended to describe.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article. What is the population?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			A <term>parameter</term> is a value (such as a percentage, average, or other measure) that describes a characteristic of an entire population. Since collecting data from every member of a population is often too time-consuming, expensive, or impossible, parameters are usually theoretical quantities that we aim to estimate. For example, the average amount of money spent on textbooks per year by all students Walla Walla University is a parameter.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_parameter">
			<idx>parameter</idx>
			<statement>
				<p>A measurement describing some characteristic of a population is called a <term>parameter</term>.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			To estimate the parameter, we select a <term>sample</term>, which is a smaller subset of the entire population. It is very important that we choose a <term>representative sample</term>, one that matches the characteristics of the population, to have a good estimate. If we survey 100 students at WWU, those students would be our sample. We will talk about how to choose a representative sample later in this section.

				<p>A <term>sample</term> is a sub-collection of subjects drawn from a given population.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			To get our <term>data</term>, we would then ask each student in the sample how much they spent on textbooks and record the answers, or <alert>raw data</alert>. Then we could calculate the average, which is our statistic. A <alert>statistic</alert> is a descriptive value calculated using data from a sample.

					A researcher wants to know how the citizens of Walla Walla feel about a voter initiative. To study this, they go downtown to Land Title Plaza and survey 500 pedestrians. Sixty percent indicate they are supportive of the initiative. Identify the population, parameter, sample and statistic. 
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					<em>Population</em>: While the intended population of this survey is Walla Walla citizens, the effective population is anyone walking through Land Title Plaza. There is no reason to assume that these pedestrians are representative of all Walla Walla citizens. (In fact, many are probably out of town visitors!)
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Parameter</em>: The parameter is what we want to know about the population, in this case the percentage of Walla Walla citizens who support the initiative.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Sample</em>: The sample is the subgroup of the population selected. The 500 pedestrians questioned make up the sample, which, again, is probably not representative of the population.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Statistic</em>: The statistic is calculated using the data from the sample. The percentage of people sampled who support the initiative is 60%.

		<title>Sampling</title>
		<p>
			Before conducting any survey, we need to clearly identify our target population. Let's say a politician hires you to gauge their support for a potential reelection campaign. Who exactly should you survey?
		</p>
		<p>
			The obvious answer might be <q>everyone in the district,</q> but that's not very practical. Eligible voters would be better, but what about those who haven't registered yet? Even registered voters don't always show up on election day. This is why many pollsters focus on <q>likely voters</q> instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Defining a <q>likely voter</q> isn't straightforward, however, and the challenges don't end there. The following example highlights some of the difficulties that arise in political polling.
		</p>
		<example>
			<p>
				In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse <q>The Body</q> Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.
						</p>
					</li> 
					<li>
						<p>
							Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				That said, one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to <term>sampling bias</term>: they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.
			</p>
		</example>
		<p>
			Identifying the population can be tricky, but once we know who we're studying, how do we choose a good sample? We want our sample statistic to accurately estimate the population parameter, which means we need a representative sample. Going back to our political polling example: we wouldn't expect accurate results if we only surveyed Starbucks customers or your TikTok followers<mdash/>groups might not reflect the broader voting population. So how can we select a sample that truly reflects the characteristics of our population?
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection xml:id="subsec_statistics_sampling_methods">
		<title>Sampling Methods</title>	
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Since it's important to select a sample that accurately represents the population we're studying, we must be careful in how we choose it. This means not only avoiding samples that fail to reflect the population but also guarding against unintentional bias in the way data is collected. To ensure a representative sample, the selection process must be truly random. However, there are several ways to achieve randomness. In this section, we'll explore four methods of random sampling, along with one method that falls short of being random.
			</p>
		</introduction>
		<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-statistics_sampling_SRS">
			<title>Simple Random Sample (SRS)</title>
			<p>
				The simplest way to use randomness to collect a sample is to collect a <term>simple random sample</term>.
			</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_simple-random-sample">
				<idx><h>sample</h><h>simple random sample</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>
						A <term>simple random sample</term> of size <m>n</m> is a sample drawn from a population in such a way that every group of <m>n</m> subjects in the population is equally likely to be chosen.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<example>
				<p>
					Imagine that each student currently enrolled at Walla Walla University has their ID number written on a slip of paper and placed in a basket. After mixing the slips thoroughly, 100 are randomly selected. This process creates a simple random sample.
				</p>
			</example>
			<p>
				In practice, computers are better suited for this kind of task. Still, even a random sample might not perfectly reflect the population. For instance, if we repeatedly select samples of 100 student ID numbers from the basket, some samples might include a slightly higher number of students from one major or class year than others. Some samples might have more first-year students, while others might include more seniors. This natural difference from sample to sample is called <term>sampling variation</term>. When we want to ensure certain groups are represented, we need to use a different sampling method.
			</p>
		</subsubsection>
		<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-statistics_sampling_systematic">
			<title>Systematic Sample</title>
			<p>
				A <term>systematic sample</term> is particularly useful when the population from which we are sampling is already ordered. Examples of this include products coming off of an assembly line, or cars moving through a sobriety check point.
			</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_systematic_sample">
				<idx><h>sample</h><h>systematic sample</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>A <term>systematic sample</term> is a random sample collected from an ordered population by randomly choosing one of the first <m>k</m> subjects, and then selecting every <m>k</m>th subject thereafter.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<example>
				<p>
					ASWWU is conducting a survey to find out whether WWU students would prefer different operating hours at the Atlas. To gather responses, student workers stand outside the Caf and survey the third student to exit the building, then every tenth student thereafter.

		</subsubsection>
		<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-statistics_sampling_stratified">
			<title>Stratified Sample</title>
			<p>
				In a <term>stratified sample</term> we group the population by characteristics which we think may make a difference, and then select randomly from each group. For example, we may want to ensure that both men and women are included in a drug study, so we select some men and some women. Or we may wish to ensure that voters of all political leanings are included in an election poll.
			</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_stratified_sample">
				<idx><h>sample</h><h>stratified sample</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>In a <term>stratified sample</term>, a population is broken into several groups (called strata) and then a simple random sample is collected from each of these groups.</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<example>
				<p>
					Suppose voter registration data for the state shows that the electorate consists of 39% Democrats, 37% Republicans, and 24% Independents. A political action group wishes to survey 1000 people about a particular initiative. To ensure the sample reflects this composition, a stratified sampling method is used. From a total sample of 1,000 voters, researchers randomly select 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans, and 240 Independents from their respective groups. This approach guarantees that each political affiliation is proportionally represented in the sample.

		<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-statistics_sampling_cluster">
			<title>Cluster Sample</title>
			<p>
				The difference between a <term>cluster sample</term> and a stratified sample lies in how the groups are used. In a stratified sample, the population is divided into groups (strata), and a random sample is taken from each group. In contrast, a cluster sample involves dividing the population into clusters, then randomly selecting entire clusters and including all individuals within those clusters in the sample.

					Your eccentric uncle is convinced there's a government cover-up of UFO sightings. To investigate, he decides to conduct a study.

			<title>Convenience Sample</title>

				If we use a sampling technique that lacks an element of randomness, we risk producing a sample that does not accurately represent the population. One of the simplest<mdash/>yet most problematic<mdash/>methods of data collection is the <term>convenience sample</term>. It's important to note that convenience samples should <em>never</em> be used in statistical analysis, as they often lead to biased and unreliable results.

	<subsection xml:id="sec_statistics_study_types">
		<title>Types of Studies</title>
		<p>
			Samples are collected from populations for two main reasons. The first is to conduct an <alert>observational study</alert><mdash/>a study based on observations or measurements. These may be <q>solicited</q>, such as in surveys or polls, or <q>unsolicited</q>, like observing how many drivers turn right at a red light despite a <q>no turn on red</q> sign.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second reason is to perform an <alert>experiment</alert>, where a <alert>treatment</alert> is applied to subjects to observe their response. In experiments, isolating the effect of the treatment is crucial to ensure valid results. The following example gives examples of treatments.
		</p>
		<example>
			<p>
				<ol marker="a.">
					<li>
						<p>
							A pharmaceutical company tests a new medicine for treating Alzheimer's disease by administering the drug to 50 elderly patients with recent diagnoses. The treatment here is the new drug.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							A gym tests out a new weight loss program by enlisting 30 volunteers to try out the program. The treatment here is the new program.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							A psychology researcher explores the effect of music on affect by measuring people's mood while listening to different types of music. The music is the treatment.

						<p>
							Suppose a middle school finds that their students are not scoring well on the state's standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if a new curriculum would improve scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and teach a class using the new curriculum. To their delight, they see an improvement in test scores.
						</p>
						<p>
							The difficulty with the last scenario is that it is not clear whether the new curriculum or the math specialist is responsible for the improvement. This is called confounding and it is the downfall of many experiments, though it is often hidden.

		<title>Statistical Bias</title>
		<p>
			There is no way to correct for biased data, so it is important to carefully plan the entire study and data analysis process in advance. One type of bias, discussed earlier, is <term>sampling</term> or <term>selection bias</term>, which occurs when the sample does not accurately reflect the population. A specific example of this is <term>voluntary response bias</term>, which arises when data is collected only from individuals who choose to participate. This can lead to bias if those who volunteer differ significantly from the general population. Below is a summary of other common sources of bias to consider.
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection xml:id="subsection_statistics_confidence_interval">
		<title>Margin of Error and Confidence Intervals</title>
		<p>
			Even when a study or experiment has successfully avoided bias and has been well done, there is still an element of variation. If we took 5 different random samples of 100 college students and calculated their average textbook cost, we wouldn't expect to get the exact same average for each sample. This is due to sampling variation. To account for this, researchers publish their margin of error or a confidence interval for their statistics. These numbers describe the precision of the estimate for a certain confidence level. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You've probably heard something like, <q>The candidate has 54 percent of the likely voters, plus or minus three percent.</q> The 3% is called the <term>margin of error</term>, so the true percentage is somewhere between 51% and 57%, with a certain level of confidence. To write this as a <term>confidence interval</term>, we place the numbers in parentheses from smallest to largest, separated by a comma: (51%, 57%).
		</p>
		<p>
			The most common <term>confidence level</term> is 95%, which means if the poll was conducted repeatedly, and we made a confidence interval each time, we would expect the true percentage, or parameter, to fall within our confidence interval 95 out of 100 times. You can learn more on how to calculate the margin of error for different confidence levels in a statistics class.
		</p>
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Let's say we asked a random sample of 100 students at Walla Walla University and found that they spent an average of $451.32 on books their first year, plus or minus $85.63. Write this as a confidence interval, assuming a 95% confidence level.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					If the margin of error was calculated to be plus or minus $85.63, then with a confidence level of 95% we could say that the average amount spent by the population is somewhere between $365.69 and $536.95.
				</p>
				<p>
					These values are found by computing <m>\$451.32 - \$85.63 = \$365.69</m> and <m>\$451.32 + \$85.63 = \$536.95</m>
				</p>
				<p>
					We could also write this as a <alert>confidence interval</alert>: ($365.69, $536.95).
				</p>
				<p>
					Now we have come full circle and seen how we can use data from a sample to estimate the parameter we were interested in for our population.
