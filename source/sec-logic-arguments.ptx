	<introduction>
		<p>
			A <term>logical argument</term> is a claim that a set of propositions, called <term>premises</term> or <term>hypotheses</term>, support a proposition called the <alert>conclusion</alert>.
			In this section we will look at <term>inductive</term> and <term>deductive</term> arguments and how to determine the strength, validity, and/or soundness of each. We will use truth tables as our primary tool for determining the validity of deductive arguments, but will also list several standard argument forms.
		</p>

	<subsection>
		<title>Inductive and Deductive Arguments</title>
		
		<p>
			The two types of arguments presented in this section are inductive and deductive arguments.  It is important to understand the difference between these two types because the analysis we apply is quite different. To better understand the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, let us begin by looking at a couple of examples.
		</p>
		<note>
			<p>
				To analyze an argument is is helpful to precisely state its premises and conclusion. Most arguments you encounter in the real world won't be stated in a precise <q>premise, premise, conclusion</q> form. Sometimes the conclusion will be stated before the premises, or the premises will be hidden within a bunch of rhetoric.
			</p>
		</note>
		<example>
			<p>
				Consider the following argument:
			</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						When I went to the store last week, I forgot my wallet, and I forgot it again when I went back today. I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
			<p>
				To begin our analysis of this first argument, let's first rewrite it in a more precise <q>premise, premise, conclusion</q> form.
			</p>
			<tabular>
				<row>
					<cell><alert>P1:</alert></cell>
					<cell>I forgot my wallet when I went to the store last week.</cell>
				</row>
				<row bottom="minor">
					<cell><alert>P2:</alert></cell>
					<cell>I forgot my wallet when I went to the store today.</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell><alert>C:</alert></cell>
					<cell>I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
			<p>
				Notice that both premises make a claim about a <alert>specific</alert> instance - the specific instance last week when I forgot my wallet, and the specific instance today when I forgot my wallet. The conclusion, on the other hand, states what we can expect to happen more generally.
			</p>
		</example>
		<p>
			Now let's consider a different argument. As you read it, think about how it differs from the previous example.
		</p>
		<example>
			<p>
				Argument:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					Henry must know CPR because he is a nurse and all nurses know CPR.					
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Just as we did for the last example, rewrite the argument in its <q>premise, premise, conclusion</q> form for clarity:
			</p>
			<tabular>
				<row>
					<cell><alert>P1:</alert></cell>
					<cell>All nurses know CPR.</cell>
				</row>
				<row bottom="minor">
					<cell><alert>P2:</alert></cell>
					<cell>Henry is a nurse.</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell><alert>C:</alert></cell>
					<cell>Henry knows CPR.</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
			<p>
				Unlike the first argument where the premises were specific and the conclusion was general, this argument's first premise is a general statement and the conclusion is specific.
			</p>
		</example>
		<p>
			We can determine whether an argument is inductive or deductive by looking at which part of the argument is general and which is specific. In the first example, the premises were specific and the conclusion was more general. This is an example of an <term>inductive</term> argument. In the second example, it was the premises that were more general and the conclusion that was specific. This is an example of a <term>deductive</term> argument. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In general, an <term>inductive argument</term> uses a collection of <em>specific</em> examples (i.e. data) as its premises and uses them to propose a <em>general</em> conclusion. This is shown in the image on the left below, where the argument moves from the narrow specific premises at the bottom up to the wide general conclusion at the top. A <term>deductive argument</term> uses a collection of <em>general statements</em> (i.e. definitions) as its premises and uses them to propose a <em>specific conclusion</em>. This is shown in the image to the right below, where the argument moves from the wide general premises at the bottom to the narrow specific conclusion at the top.

			<statement>
			<p>
				Rewrite the following arguments in a precise <q>premise, premise, conclusion</q>> form, and determine if the argument is inductive or deductive.
				<ol marker="a.">
					<li>
						<p>
							A number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and one. Since the number 13 is only divisible by itself and one, 13 must be prime. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Juan's dog Goober is having puppies. All three of Goober's previous litters have had 5 puppies so Goober is bound to have 5 puppies in this litter as well. 
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>

							</row>
							<row>
								<cell><alert>C:</alert></cell>
								<cell>13 is prime.</cell>
							</row>
						</tabular>
						<p>
							Since the premises are general definitions and properties of numbers and the conclusion is a specific statement about the number 13, the argument is <alert>deductive</alert>.

							</row>
							<row>
								<cell><alert>C:</alert></cell>
								<cell>Goober's current litter will have 5 puppies.</cell>
							</row>
						</tabular>
						<p>
							This is an example of an <alert>inductive argument</alert> since it uses specific experiences/instances as its premises, and its conclusion is a general expectation based on those specific experiences.

		<title>Evaluating Arguments</title>
		<p>
			Inductive arguments cannot be proven. The best we can do is evaluate the <term>strength</term> of the argument based on the evidence it provides.
		</p> 
		<p>
			A strong inductive argument is one that is well supported by its premises, while a weak inductive argument is one whose premises do a poor job of supporting the conclusion. The strength of an inductive argument is subjective, because where one person sees a strong argument, another may see a weak argument. Additionally, the strength and truth of an argument are not necessarily related; it is possible to have a weak argument that is true, and a strong argument that is false.
		</p>
		<example>
			<statement>
			<p>
				Determine the strength of the inductive argument. 
			</p>
			<p>
				James Franco, Jodie Foster, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jack Nicholson have all won Academy Awards for acting. Actors whose names start with J are bound to win an Academy Award.
			</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The inductive argument provides a number of specific cases as evidence for the conclusion. However, we would not be surprised if a J-named actor <em>did not</em> win an Academy Award, so the argument is weak.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			Deductive arguments, on the other hand, can be proven and their validity and soundness can be evaluated. The <term>validity</term> of the argument is based on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, while the <term>soundness</term> of the argument is based on whether or not the premises are true. An argument cannot be sound if it is not valid, even if the premises seem reasonable. 
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection>
		<title>Evaluating Deductive Arguments Using Truth Tables</title>
			<p>
				There are various ways to evaluate deductive logical arguments. Our focus here will be the use of truth tables. In this method, the verbal argument is translated into mathematical notation and all possible truth values of the statement are organized in a table. The argument is valid when the conclusion is true whenever all premises are true, and invalid when there is at least one scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. 
				The advantage of this method is that it requires no knowledge of logical forms. However, it can be tedious for complicated problems, especially those requiring more than 2 or 3 propositions.
			</p>
			<example>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Suppose each of the following statements are true:
						<ol>
							<li>Either the security system was activated or the alarm went off, but not both.</li>
							<li>The alarm did not go off.</li>
						</ol>
						Prove that "The security system was activated."
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						First, define the necessary logical variables:
						<ul>
							<li>Let <m>S</m> = <q>The security system was activated</q></li>
							<li>Let <m>A</m> = <q>The alarm went off</q></li>
						</ul>
						The first statement can be written as: <m>(S \lor A) \land \lnot(S \land A)</m>, which is more simply written using the symbol for the exclusive OR  <m>S \oplus A</m>.
						Similarly, the second statement may be written as <m>\lnot A</m>, and the conclusion is simply <m>S</m>. 
						In its briefest form, the argument is thus
					</p>
					<tabular>
						<row>
							<cell><alert>P1:</alert></cell>
							<cell><m>S \oplus A</m>,</cell>
						</row>
						<row bottom="minor">
							<cell><alert>P2:</alert></cell>
							<cell><m>\lnot A</m>,</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell><alert>C:</alert></cell>
							<cell><m>S</m>.</cell>
						</row>
					</tabular>
					<p>
						To evaluate this argument we need a truth table with columns for <m>S</m>, <m>A</m>, <m>S \oplus A</m>, and <m>\neg A</m>.
					</p>
					<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
						<row header="yes">
							<cell>C: <m>S</m></cell>
							<cell><m>A</m></cell>
							<cell>P1: <m>S \oplus A</m></cell>
							<cell>P2: <m>\neg A</m></cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>T</cell>
							<cell>T</cell>
							<cell>F</cell>
							<cell>F</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>T</cell>
							<cell>F</cell>
							<cell>T</cell>
							<cell>T</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>F</cell>
							<cell>T</cell>
							<cell>T</cell>
							<cell>F</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>F</cell>
							<cell>F</cell>
							<cell>F</cell>
							<cell>T</cell>
						</row>
					</tabular>
					<p>
						To evaluate the argument, we ask if the conclusion is true every time the premises are true. Row two of the truth table shows this to be the case. <alert>P1</alert> and <alert>P2</alert> (columns 2 and 4) are true and the conclusion (first column) is true as well.  Thus, this is a <alert>valid</alert> argument.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>
				Here is an example requiring three proportions.
			</p>
			<example>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Suppose each of the following statements are true:
						<ol>
							<li>It is snowing.</li>
							<li>If it is warm, then it is not snowing.</li>
							<li>If it is not warm, then I cannot go swimming.</li>
						</ol>
						Prove: I cannot go swimming.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Begin by clearly defining the necessary logical variables:
						<ul>
							<li>Let <m>p</m> = <q>It is snowing.</q></li>
							<li>Let <m>q</m> = <q>It is warm.</q></li>
							<li>Let <m>r</m> = <q>I can go swimming.</q></li>
						</ul>
						You could of course write <m>r</m> as the negative <q>I cannot go swimming</q>, but writing the statements without negatives reduces the confusion of potential double negatives later in a problem. Using these symbols, the argument can be summarized as:
					</p>
					<tabular>
						<row>
							<cell><alert>P1:</alert></cell>
							<cell><m>p</m>,</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell><alert>P2:</alert></cell>
							<cell><m>q \rightarrow \neg r</m>,</cell>
						</row>
						<row bottom="minor">
							<cell><alert>P3:</alert></cell>
							<cell><m>\lnot q \rightarrow \neg r</m>,</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell><alert>C:</alert></cell>
							<cell><m>\lnot r</m>.</cell>
						</row>
					</tabular>
					<p>
						Next, create a truth table for the above argument, where each premise and the conclusion appear in a column. Here is the table for this example.
					</p>
					<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
						<row header="yes">

					</tabular>
				</solution>
				<p>
					Row 4 of this table shows that the argument is valid. In this row, each of the 3 premises is true as is the conclusion.
				</p>
			</example>
			<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-logic-tabular-proof">
				<title>Summary: Tabular Method</title>
				<p>
					To test the validity of an argument (i.e. prove or disprove):
					<ol>
						<li> Write the verbal argument in symbolic form.</li>
						<li> Draw a truth table where each premise and the conclusion gets its own column. Do this all in one (possibly large!) table.</li>
						<li>Locate all rows where where <alert>all</alert> of the premises are true.</li>
						<li>Look at each row from the previous step. Is the conclusion also true? If it is also true on each row, then the argument is valid (or true). Otherwise, the argument is not valid.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</assemblage>
			<p>
				Even one instance where the premises are true and the conclusion false invalidates an argument. It does not matter if there is another row in the table where the premises are true and the conclusion is true. The next example illustrates an invalid argument.

			<example xml:id="ex-logic-invalid-argument-table">
				<statement>
					<p>
						Evaluate the validity of the following argument.

						</p>
					</blockquote>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						First, define the necessary logical variables:
						<ul>
							<li>Let <m>p</m> = <q>Taxes are cut.</q></li>
							<li>Let <m>q</m> = <q>Retail sales increase.</q></li>

						Notice that in rows 1 and 8 each premise and the conclusion are true. This might make you think the argument is valid.

To be valid <em>every</em> row where the premises are true must have a true conclusion as well.
