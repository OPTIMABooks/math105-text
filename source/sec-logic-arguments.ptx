	<introduction>
		<p>
			A <term>logical argument</term> is a claim that a set of propositions, called <term>premises</term> or <term>hypotheses</term>, support a proposition called the <alert>conclusion</alert>.
			In this section we will look at <term>inductive</term> and <term>deductive</term> arguments and how to determine the strength, validity, and/or soundness of each. We will use truth tables as our primary tool for determining the validity of deductive arguments, but will also list several standard argument forms.
