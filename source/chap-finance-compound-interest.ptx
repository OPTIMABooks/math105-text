  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the last section, we examined problems involving simple interest.  Simple interest is generally charged when the lending period is short (often less than a year).   When the money is loaned or borrowed for a longer time period, interest is paid (or charged) not only on the principal, but also on the past interest. In this case we say the interest is <term>compounded</term>.
