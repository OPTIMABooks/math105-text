  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the last section, we examined problems involving simple interest.  Simple interest is generally charged when the lending period is short (often less than a year).   When the money is loaned or borrowed for a longer time period, interest is paid (or charged) not only on the principal, but also on the past interest. In this case we say the interest is <term>compounded</term>.  
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
    <title>APR – Annual Percentage Rate</title>
    <p>
      Interest rates are usually stated as an <term>annual percentage rate (APR)</term> – the total interest that will be paid in the year. If not stated otherwise, assume that the interest rate is an annual rate or APR. If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR will be divided by the number of time periods.
      The APR divided by the number of time periods is called the <term>periodic interest rate</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires that every consumer be given the true APR which includes the interest and any fees included.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a 6% APR paid monthly, would be divided by 12, because you would get one twelfth of the rate per month, which is a periodic interest rate of half a percent per month.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <me>\frac{0.06}{12}=0.005</me>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Similarly, a 4% annual rate paid quarterly would be divided by 4 to get a periodic interest rate of 1% per quarter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <me>\frac{0.04}{4}=0.01</me>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Here is an example of a semi-annual rate.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you buy a $1,000 federal bond with a 4% annual simple interest rate, paid semi-annually, with a maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn? What will be the future value of the bond?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>
        <m>P = \$1000</m>, the principal
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>r=\frac{0.04}{2}=0.02</m>, interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), so the 4% interest will be divided into two 2% payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>t = 8</m>, 4 years compounded twice a year gives <m>t=4\cdot 2=8</m> half-years
      </p>

          <mrow>\amp=\$160</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        You will earn $160 in interest over the four years. The future value of the loan is

    </example>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Compound Interest</title>
    <p>
      In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest. This reinvestment of interest is called <alert>compounding</alert>. We will develop the mathematical formula for compound interest and then show the equivalent spreadsheet function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow?
    </p>
    <p>
      The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn <m>\frac{0.03}{12}=0.0025</m> per month.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first month,
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <md>
      <mrow>P\amp= \$1000</mrow>
      <mrow>r\amp=0.0025</mrow>
      <mrow>I\amp= \$1000 (0.0025)= \$2.50</mrow>
      <mrow>A\amp= \$1000 + \$2.50 = \$1002.50</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second month,
    </p>
    <p>
      <md>
        <mrow>P\amp=\$1002.50</mrow>
        <mrow>I\amp=\$1002.50(0.0025)=\$2.51 \text{ (rounded)}</mrow>
        <mrow>A\amp=\$1002.50+\$2.51=\$1005.01</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding gives us.

      To find an equation to represent this, we will go through a few months to see the pattern:
    </p>
    <p>
      Initial Amount: <m>P=\$1000</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>1^{\text{st}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(\$1000)</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>2^{\text{nd}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(1.0025(\$1000))=1.0025^{2}(\$1000)</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>3^{\text{rd}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(1.0025^{2}(\$1000))=1.0025^{3}(\$1000)</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>4^{\text{th}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(1.0025^{3}(\$1000))=1.0025^{4}(\$1000)</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing a pattern, we could conclude
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>n^{\text{th}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025^{n}(\$1000).</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the interest rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year. Generalizing our result, we could write

    <title>Comparing Simple and Compound Interest</title>
      <p>
        Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding in the previous example against the amount you would earn from simple interest. From the table and graph below we can see that over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and exponential growth.

      <title>Finding the Amount of Interest Earned and the Percentage</title>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="future_value"/> suppose we also want to know how much interest was earned and what percentage of the final balance is from interest. The future value of the investment is $5,009.92. To figure out how much of that was interest, we need to subtract the amount initially deposited.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>Key Idea:</alert> Total interest is always the difference between the account balance and the amount deposited (or paid).
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
          To find the total amount of interest earned, we subtract the principal from the total balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>\$5{,}009.92-\$3{,}500=\$1{,}509.92.</me>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The depositor earned $1,509.82 in interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the percentage of the total that is interest, divide the amount of interest by the total amount of the future value.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>\frac{\$1{,}509.92}{5{,}009.92}\approx0.3014\text{ or } 30.1\%</me>.
          That is, after 4 years 30.1% of the account balance is due to interest.
