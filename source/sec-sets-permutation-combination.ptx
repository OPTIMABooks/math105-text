	<introduction>
		<p>
			In this section we build on the multiplication principle discussed in the previous section. We start with factorials, which establish the mathematical foundation for the second topic, permutations, which are in turn the building block of combinations. Taken together with the addition and multiplication rule, these three mathematical tools allow us to solve a variety of useful counting problems.
		</p>
	</introduction>
	<subsection xml:id="subsec-sets-factorial">
		<title>Factorials</title>
		<p>
			The following example shows how the <term>factorial</term> is a special case of the <xref ref="thm_counting-rule_multiplication" text="custom"> multiplication principle</xref>.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_counting_factorial_dolls">
			<title>Arranging Items</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					You want to display your four favorite collectibles on your shelf: a Minecraft Steve figure, a Pikachu plush, a Lego Harry Potter minifigure, and a Mario Kart Hot Wheels car. In how many different ways can you arrange them in a row?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>This is an example of the multiplication rule using the following steps.
					<ol>
						<li><p>Chose which of the 4 items to place first (4 choices)</p></li>
						<li><p>Choose which of the 3 remaining items to place 2nd (3 choices)</p></li>
						<li><p>Choose which of the 2 remaining items to place 3rd (2 choices left)</p></li>
						<li><p>Choose which of the 1 remaining items to place at the end of the row (only one choice).</p></li>
					</ol>
					Therefore, according to the multiplication rule, the number of orderings is:
					<me> 4\times 3\times 2 \times 1 = 24</me>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			Notice that because we were selecting from our group of items without replacing them, the number of choices went down by one each time. When we use the multiplication rule with this sort of process, we wind up multiplying the numbers between 1 and the original number of choices. This product has a special name.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_factorial">
			<idx>factorial</idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					For any positive integer <m>n</m>, <m>n!</m> (read <q><m>n</m> <em>factorial</em></q>) is the product of the numbers between <m>1</m> and <m>n</m>. That is:
					<me>
						n! = n\times(n-1)\times \cdots \times 2\times 1
					</me>.
					Also, by definition, 
					<me>
						0! = 1.
					</me>
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			In the next example we practice computing factorials. Note how quickly the value of a factorial grows as <m>n</m> grows. Also, notice that when dividing factorials, canceling is a very useful tool.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_counting_factorial_compute">
			<title>Computing Factorials</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Find the value of each expression below.
					<ol marker="a." cols="3">
						<li><p><m>5!</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>8!</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>\frac{8!}{5!}</m></p></li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Using the definition above,
					<ol marker="a.">
						<li><p><m>5! = 5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1 = 120</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>8! = 8\times 7\times 6\times 5! = 336\times 120 = 40320</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>\frac{8!}{5!} = \frac{8\times 7\times 6\times 5!}{5!} = \frac{8\times 7\times 6}{1} = 336</m>.</p></li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Six WWU students line up for a photo that will appear in the local paper. The photographer arranges them in a line down the steps of Meske Hall. How many different ways can the student be arranged?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Because each student can only be placed in one position, the number of students decreases with each choice. That is, 6 students can be on the top step, but then only 5 remain to be selected for the second step, 4 for the third step, and so on. Thus, there are
					<me>
						6! = 6\times 5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1 = 720
					</me>
					possible arrangements.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

	<subsection xml:id="subsec_sets_counting_permutations">
		<title>Permutations</title>
		<p>
			In some counting problems, the process resembles the one used in factorial-based problems, but we are not required to use or arrange all of the items. Here is an example.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_counting_permutation_runners">
			<title>Ordering a Subset</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose that ten runners compete in a race in which first, second, and third prizes are awarded. In how many ways can these prizes be won?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Using the multiplication rule, the steps in this process are:
					<ol>
						<li><p>Award first prize. Any of the 10 runners could be 1st.</p></li>
						<li><p>Award second prize. Nine runners could come in 2nd.</p></li>
						<li><p>Award third prize. Eight runners could come in 3rd.</p></li>
					</ol>
					Thus, prizes can be awarded
					<me>10\times 9\times 8 = 720</me>
					ways.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			While the solution to the above problem started off looking like a factorial, <m>10 \times 9 \times 8</m>, it stopped after 8 because we didn't need to order the remaining seven runners in this race. In general, when we need to count the number of ways to order or arrange <m>r</m> items chosen from <m>n</m> possible items, we are using a <term>permutation</term>.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def-sets-permutation-in-words">
			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>permutation</term> of a set of elements is an ordered arrangement where each element is used once. 
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<fact xml:id="fact-sets-permutation-formula">
			<idx>permutation</idx>
			<idx><h>counting rules</h><h>permutation</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>permutation of n items taken r at a time</term> is used to count the number of ways to arrange (or permute) <m>r</m> items chosen from <m>n</m> possible items. The formula for this permutation is:
					<me>
						P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
					</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<alert>Note:</alert> Scientific calculators have built-in permutation functions. If you're unsure how to use yours or whether to use it instead of the formula above, ask your instructor for guidance.
			</p>
			</statement>
		</fact>
		<p>
			Applying this formula to the foot-race example above, we could have computed:
			<me>
				P(10,3) = \frac{10!}{(10-3)!} = \frac{10\times 9\times 8\times 7!}{7!} = 10\times 9\times 8 = 720
			</me>.
			Permutations are a general method used to count the number of ways to complete a process when the order of completion matters. A race is a good example of a situation where order is important. Another example is provided below.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_counting_permutation_bands">
			<title>Using Permutations</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Six bands have expressed interest in performing at a concert, which has time slots for three performances. In how many different ways can the concert manager schedule the performances?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Since there are 6 bands to choose from and only 3 are needed, and because the order of performance matters (changing the order creates a different schedule), the number of possible schedules is:
					<me>
						P(6,3) = \frac{6!}{3!} = 6\times 5\times 4 = 120
					</me>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			There are a few general results that hold no matter what <m>n</m> is used in a permutation. Three of these are shown below.
		<ul>
			<li><p><m>P(n,n) = \frac{n!}{(n-n)!} = \frac{n!}{0!} = n!</m></p></li>
			<li><p><m>P(n,0) = \frac{n!}{(n-0)!} = \frac{n!}{n!} = 1</m></p></li>
			<li><p><m>P(n,1) = \frac{n!}{(n-1)!} = \frac{n\times (n-1)!}{(n-1)!} = n</m></p></li>
		</ul>
		Additionally, the formula shown in <xref ref="fact-sets-permutation-formula"/> algebraically reduces to the following form,
		<me>
			P(n,r) = \underbrace{n\times (n-1) \times \cdots \times (n-r+1)}_{r \text { items}}
		</me>,
		which looks like the multiplication rule.  You may find this easier to use than the version written with factorials.
		</p>

	<subsection xml:id="subsec_sets_counting_combinations">
		<title>Combinations</title>
		<p>
			Permutations are useful when the order in which we select objects matters<mdash/>as in running a race or creating a schedule. However, order does not always matter. In such cases, we need to change the way we count. This important distinction is illustrated in the following example.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_sets_counting_combination_movies">
			<title>Counting when Order Doesn't Matter</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					You have two extra movie tickets and want to invite two of your four good friends to join you. In how many different ways can you choose which friends to take to the movies?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Suppose your friends names are: Alice, Bob, Candace, and David. If you try to count the number of ways you could invite two friends using a permutation, you get:
					<me>
						P(4,2) = 4\times 3 = 12
					</me>.
					However, this is not the correct answer. To see why, make a list of possible choices that the permutation counts.
				</p>
				<table>
					<title>Possible selections.</title>
					<tabular>
						<row>
							<cell>AB</cell>
							<cell>BA</cell>
							<cell>CA</cell>
							<cell>DA</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>AC</cell>
							<cell>BC</cell>
							<cell>CB</cell>
							<cell>DB</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>AD</cell>
							<cell>BD</cell>
							<cell>CD</cell>
							<cell>DC</cell>
						</row>
					</tabular>
				</table>
				<p>
					Notice that each pair appears twice. For example, AB and BA are counted separately but these two pairs represent inviting the same group of friends to a movie. This is because in a permutation, the order in which we hand out the tickets makes a difference. 
					But really, we don't care who got the first ticket<mdash/>we just want to know who is going. Since there are two of each possible pairs, the actual number of ways to pick the two friends to go with us is:
					<me>
						\frac{P(4,2)}{P(2,2)} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
					</me>.
					The <m>P(2,2)</m> in the denominator is the number of orderings of 2 objects, which needs to be divided out of the permutation because order doesn't matter here.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			In the example above, we arrived at the final solution using two steps. First, we counted the number of ways to pick the friends to go with us if the order did matter, in this case it was 12. Then we counted the number of ways that those two friends could be arranged, which was 2. 
			Finally, we divide the 12 ordered ways by the 2 different orderings to get a total of 6 ways to choose our two friends if the order does not matter. This process can be combined into a single counting rule called a combination.

		<fact xml:id="fact_sets_counting-rule_combination">
			<idx>combination</idx>
			<idx><h>counting rules</h><h>combination</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>combination of n items taken r at a time </term> is used to count the number of ways to choose <m>r</m> items from <m>n</m> possible items if the order in which we select them does not matter. The formula for this combination is:
					<me>C(n,r) = \frac{P(n,r)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}</me>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<alert>Note:</alert> Scientific calculators also have built-in combination functions. Ask your instructor for help finding this if appropriate.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</fact>
			<p>
				Applying this formula to the movie ticket example, we get:
				<me>
					C(4,2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4\times 3\times 2!}{2!\times 2!} = \frac{4\times 3}{2\times 1} = 6
				</me>.
			</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_sets_counting_combination_committee">
			<title>Using a Combination</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A committee of 10 business executives wishes to form a subcommittee of 3 members to research a strategic initiative. In how many ways can this subcommittee be selected?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The order in which a subcommittee is selected does not matter<mdash/>a person is either on the committee or not on the committee. Therefore, this is a combination and the solution is:
					<me>
						C(10,3) = \frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \frac{10\times 9\times 8 \times 7!}{3!\times 7!} = \frac{10\times 9\times 8}{3\times 2\times 1} = 120
					</me>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			As with permutations, there are a few general rules that combinations follow no matter what the value of <m>n</m> is. Several of these rules are shown below.
		  <ul>
		  	<li><p><m>C(n,n) = 1</m></p></li>
		  	<li><p><m>C(n,1) = n</m></p></li>
		  	<li><p><m>C(n,r) = C(n,n-r)</m></p></li>
		  </ul>
			The definition of the combination shown above simplifies to a form you may find easier to use: 
		 	<me> 
				C(n,r) = \frac{\overbrace{n\times (n-1) \times \cdots \times (n-r+1)}^{r \text{ values}}}{r!}
			</me>.
