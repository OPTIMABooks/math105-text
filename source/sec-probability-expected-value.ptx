	<introduction>
		<p>
			Finding the <term>expected value</term> is a useful application of probability. It has many applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and it's a topic that the casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and lotteries may hope most people never learn about!
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<subsection xml:id="subsec-probability-models">
		<title>Probability Models</title>
		<p>
			Before we can compute an expected value, we need to understand what a <term>probability distribution</term> (also called a <term>probability model</term>) is. The example below will help illustrate this concept and show how a distribution might arise. We will then use this example to introduce and develop the idea of expected value.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose you are commissioned to design a game for the annual College Place Block Party to raise money for the Blue Mountain Humane Society. In your proposed game, players roll a six-sided die. If they roll a 6 on the first try, they win $10. If they roll any other number, they get a second chance. 
			On the second roll, if they roll a 6, they win $3. If they fail to roll a 6 on the second attempt, they lose. With the game design complete, your next task is to determine how much to charge players in order to ensure a profit over the long run.
		</p>
		<p>
			To make a profit, the organizers need to know how much they will pay in winnings, on average, over the long run and charge more than that amount. In other words, they must charge more than the <em>expected value</em> of the game. To figure out the average winnings, you need to tabulate all the possible outcomes of the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			One way to do this is with a probability model. A <term>probability model</term> or <term>probability distribution</term> is a table listing all possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities. The outcomes will be the amounts a player can win, and we will calculate the probabilities using what we have learned about theoretical probability.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is the probability model for the carnival game. Note that the probabilities in a probability distribution must add to 1.

	<subsection xml:id="subsec-probability-expected-val">
		<title>Expected Value</title>
		<p>
			Think of the expected value as a weighted average. In the Block Party example above, we could take the average of $10, $3, and $0, but they are not all equally likely. It is much more likely to win $0 than it is to win $10. So, to find the average, we multiply each outcome by the chance it will happen and add the products together. This is the <term>expected value</term> of the game.
		</p>
		<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-expected-value">
			<title>Expected Value</title>
			<p>
				To find the <term>expected value</term> of an experiment, multiply each possible outcome by its probability and sum the products.
			</p>
		</assemblage>
		<p>
			For the Block Party example we have:
			<md>
				<mrow> \text{Expected winnings} \amp= \$10\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)+\$3\left(\frac{5}{36}\right)+\$0\left(\frac{25}{36}\right) </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp =\$2.08 </mrow>
			</md>
			This tells us that over the long run, players can expect to win $2.08 per game. This also means that the game organizer will be paying out an average of $2.08 per game. Since the game is intended to be a fundraiser, the organizers need to charge <em>more</em> than $2.08 per game in order to raise money.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the game organizers charge exactly $2.08 to play, the game is considered a <term>fair game</term> since the expected winnings would be $0. In a fair game, the player isn't expected to win anything, nor is the owner expected to earn anything over the long run. However, if organizers charge the player more than $2.08 to play, they will earn money over the long run.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose you suggest charging $5 to play the game. We can determine the net winnings by subtracting the $5 the player has to pay from their expected winnings. This gives us:
			<md>
				<mrow>\text{Net player winnings}\amp=\$2.08-\$5</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp=-\$2.92 </mrow>
			</md>
			This means that, over the long run, players can expect to lose an average of $2.92 per game, while the organizers can expect to fundraise an average of $2.92 per game.
		</p>

			<statement>
				<p>
					Pick4 is a game by the Oregon Lottery that costs $1 to play. In this game you pick 4 numbers in a specific pattern. If the chosen number matches the winning number exactly, the player receives a big payout. Smaller payouts are possible for other matching conditions. Suppose that the payouts are as follows. Determine the player's expected net winnings.

				<p>
					The provided table is not quite a complete probability distribution since it is missing one important outcome: when the player loses. In that case the prize is $0. We need to add a line for this. The prize for this missing outcome is $0, and since losing is the complement to winning <em>something</em>, the probability will be:
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>P(\text{Win }\$0)\amp=1-(\frac{1}{417}+\frac{1}{1833}+\frac{1}{1667}+\frac{1}{2500})</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp=1-0.0039</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp=0.9961</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p></p>
				
				<p>
					Adding this information to the table gives a complete probability distribution. Now we can see that players are going to lose more than 99% of the time, so the expected value will be heavily weighted toward winning $0.
				</p>

				<p>
					<md>
					<mrow>\text{Expected winnings}\amp=\$250\left(\frac{1}{417}\right)+\$500\left(\frac{1}{1833}\right)</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp +\$1000\left(\frac{1}{16773}\right)+\$1500\left(\frac{1}{2500}\right) </mrow>
					<mrow>\amp +\$0(0.9961)</mrow>
					<mrow> \amp </mrow>
					<mrow>\amp =\$2.07</mrow>
				</md>
				</p>

				<p>
					Therefore, the player's expected winnings are $2.07, on average, over the long run. To find the expected <alert>net</alert> winnings, we subtract the cost to play. Since it costs $1 to play,
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
					<mrow>\text{Net Expected Winnings}=\$2.07-\$1.00=\$1.07.</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					Assuming the given payouts are correct, this would be one game you would want to play for investment purposes since you can expect to earn $1.07 per game, on average, over the long run. Play a million times, and you just might become a millionaire!
