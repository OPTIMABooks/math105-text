	<introduction>
		<p>
			Finding the <term>expected value</term> is a useful application of probability. It has many applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and it's a topic that the casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and lotteries may hope most people never learn about!

		<title>Probability Models</title>
		<p>
			Before we can compute an expected value, we need to understand what a <term>probability distribution</term> (also called a <term>probability model</term>) is. The example below will help illustrate this concept and show how a distribution might arise. We will then use this example to introduce and develop the idea of expected value.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose you are commissioned to design a game for the annual College Place Block Party to raise money for the Blue Mountain Humane Society. In your proposed game, players roll a six-sided die. If they roll a 6 on the first try, they win $10. If they roll any other number, they get a second chance. 
			On the second roll, if they roll a 6, they win $3. If they fail to roll a 6 on the second attempt, they lose. With the game design complete, your next task is to determine how much to charge players in order to ensure a profit over the long run.
		</p>
		<p>
			To make a profit, the organizers need to know how much they will pay in winnings, on average, over the long run and charge more than that amount. In other words, they must charge more than the <em>expected value</em> of the game. To figure out the average winnings, you need to tabulate all the possible outcomes of the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			One way to do this is with a probability model. A <term>probability model</term> or <term>probability distribution</term> is a table listing all possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities. The outcomes will be the amounts a player can win, and we will calculate the probabilities using what we have learned about theoretical probability.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is the probability model for the carnival game. Note that the probabilities in a probability distribution must add to 1.
