  <introduction>
    <p>
      For most of us it is not practical to deposit a large sum of money in the bank. Instead, we save by depositing smaller amounts of money regularly. We might save in an IRA or 401-K for retirement. We might also save for a down payment on a car or house, or in a college savings plan for our children.
