  <introduction>
    <p>
      For most of us it is not practical to deposit a large sum of money in the bank. Instead, we save by depositing smaller amounts of money regularly. We might save in an IRA or 401-K for retirement. We might also save for a down payment on a car or house, or in a college savings plan for our children, or make regular payments into an insurance account.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sequence of equal periodic payments is called an <term>annuity</term>. The payments (or deposits) can be made annually, quarterly, monthly, or at any other fixed interval of time. When the payments are made at the same time the interest is credited to the account the annuity is called an <term>simple</term> annuity. When these payments are at the end of the payment period the annuity is called <term>ordinary</term>.
      There are many types of annuities which we will ignore here. This text will only discuss simple, ordinary annuities with equal sized payments.

      <alert>Tip:</alert> If the compounding frequency is not explicitly stated in any problem you encounter in this text, assume there are the same number of compounds in a year as there are deposits.

    <title>Future Value of an Annuity</title>
    <p>
      The mathematical formula needed to solve problems involving the future value of simple, ordinary annuities is shown below. If you want to know where the formula comes from, it is derived at the end of the chapter.

      <title>Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity</title>
      <p>
        If a payment of <m>d</m> dollars is made in an account <m>n</m> times a year at annual interest rate  <m>r</m>, then the future value <m>A</m> after <m>t</m> years is 
        <me>
          A = d \left[\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}-1}{\frac{r}{n}}\right].
        </me>
