  <introduction>
    <p>
      For most of us it is not practical to deposit a large sum of money in the bank. Instead, we save by depositing smaller amounts of money regularly. We might save in an IRA or 401-K for retirement. We might also save for a down payment on a car or house, or in a college savings plan for our children, or make regular payments into an insurance account.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sequence of equal periodic payments is called an <term>annuity</term>. The payments (or deposits) can be made annually, quarterly, monthly, or at any other fixed interval of time. When the payments are made at the same time the interest is credited to the account the annuity is called an <term>simple</term> annuity. When these payments are at the end of the payment period the annuity is called <term>ordinary</term>.
      There are many types of annuities which we will ignore here. This text will only discuss simple, ordinary annuities with equal sized payments. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Tip:</alert> If the compounding frequency is not explicitly stated in any problem you encounter in this text, assume there are the same number of compounds in a year as there are deposits.

    <title>Future Value of an Annuity</title>
    <p>
      The mathematical formula needed to solve problems involving the future value of simple, ordinary annuities is shown below. If you want to know where the formula comes from, it is derived at the end of the chapter.

      <p>
        If a payment of <m>d</m> dollars is made in an account <m>n</m> times a year at annual interest rate  <m>r</m>, then the future value <m>A</m> after <m>t</m> years is 
        <me>
          A = d \left[\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}-1}{\frac{r}{n}}\right].

        A traditional individual retirement account (IRA) is a special type of retirement account in which the money you invest is exempt from income taxes until you withdraw it. If you deposit $100 each month into an IRA earning 6% APR, how much will you have in the account after 20 years? 
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      
      <p>
        In this example the monthly deposit is <m>d=\$100</m>, and since interest is compounded monthly <m>n = 12</m>. The annual interest rate is <m>r=0.06</m> and since we want the amount after 20 years <m>t=20</m>. The unknown value is <m>A</m>, which is the value we need to compute. Putting these values into the annuity equation we have:
      </p>
      <p>
        <md>
        <mrow> A\amp= 100\left[\frac{\left(1+\frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{12\cdot 20}-1}{\left(\frac{0.06}{12}\right)}\right]</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= 100\left[\frac{(1.005)^{240}-1}{(0.005)}\right]</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp= 100(462.040895)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp\approx \$46{,}204.09</mrow>
      </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        With U.S. dollars we round to the nearest cent. The account will grow to $46,204.09 after 20 years.
      </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Depositing $100 a month for 20 years takes a lot of discipline!  Was it worth it? How much interest did this annuity earn over 20 years?
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Key Idea:</alert> Total interest is always the difference between the account balance and the amount deposited (or paid).
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If you deposit $100 each month into an IRA earning 6% APR for 20 years, how much will you have earned in interest? What percentage of the balance is interest? Use the result of <xref ref="future_value_annuity_1"/> to find these values.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To find the <alert>amount of interest earned</alert>, calculate the total of all your deposits.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>\$100(20)(12)=\$24{,}000</me>
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The difference between the total amount and the deposits is the interest earned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>\$46{,}204.09-\$24{,}000=\$22{,}204.09</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The total amount of interest you earned was $22,204.09.
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the <alert>percentage of the balance that is interest</alert> we will divide the interest by the total balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <me>\frac{\$22{,}204.09}{\$46{,}204.09}\approx 0.4810</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          or 48.1%. After 20 years 48.1% of the balance is from interest.
        </p>

      <title>A note about rounding</title>
      <p>
        If you are using the formulas and round during intermediate steps you will probably have some roundoff error. For this reason, we enter the whole expression into the calculator and do not show the intermediate steps. Alternately, you can enter the parts of the equation separately but use the calculators stored values for subsequent computations.
