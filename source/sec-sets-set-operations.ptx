  <introduction>
    <p>
      The idea of a <term>set</term> allows us to treat distinct objects as a single entity. For example, we could use <m>S</m> to represent the four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter.  That is,
      <me>
        S = \left\{\text{spring, summer, fall, winter} \right\}.
      </me>
      By classifying items as groups (sets), we can also investigate relationships between groups, or consider overlap between groups when counting items.
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>set</term> is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called the <term>elements</term> (or <term>members</term>) of the set.

    <title>Set Notation</title>
    <p>
      A set can be defined by describing the contents, or by listing the elements of the set, enclosed in curly brackets. Symbolically, sets are represented using capital letters and braces { } are used to enclose the sets elements. 
      The method of listing the elements of a set in braces is called <term>roster</term> notation. A second method is to use <term>set-builder notation</term>, where braces and a vertical line | (read <q>such that</q>) is used to describe the contents of a set.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Describing a set by its contents:
        <ol marker="a)">
          <li>
            <p>
              The set of all even numbers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The seasons of the year
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Roster notation:
        <ol marker="a)">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>E = \{0,2,4,6,8\}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>C = \{\text{red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple} \}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Set builder notation:
        <ol marker="a)">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>S = \{x \mid x \text{ is a student at WWU}\}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>E = \{x \mid 2x \text{ is a whole number} \}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        Julia, Keenan, Jae and Colin took a test. They got the following scores: 70, 95, 85 and 70. Let <m>P</m> be the set of test takers and <m>S</m> be the set of test scores. List the elements of each set using set notation.
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In this example, the set of people taking the test is <m>P= \{\text{Julia, Keenan, Jae, Colin}\}</m>, and the set of test scores is <m>S = \{70, 85, 95\}</m>. Notice in this example that even though two people scored a 70 on the test, the score of 70 is only listed once.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Sometimes a collection might not contain all the elements of a set.  For example, suppose Chris owns three Madonna albums.  While Chris's collection is a set, we can also say it is a subset of the larger set of all Madonna albums.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two sets. Then <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m>, written <m>A\subseteq B</m>, if and only if every element of <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two sets. We say that <m>A</m> is a <term>equal</term> to <m>B</m>, written <m>A = B</m>, if and only if <m>A\subseteq B</m> and <m>B\subseteq A</m>. That is, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> contain the same elements.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider the three sets
        <me>
          A = \{1,2,3\},\quad B = \{1,2,3,4,5\},\quad C = \{3,2,1\}.
        </me>
        Then each of the following set relationships is true:
        <ol marker="a)">
          <li>
            <p><m>A \subseteq B</m></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><m>A = C</m></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><m>A \subseteq C</m></p>
          </li>
        </ol>
