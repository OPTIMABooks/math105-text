	<introduction>
		<p>
			The idea of a <term>set</term> allows us to treat distinct objects as a single entity. For example, we could use <m>S</m> to represent the four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter.  That is,
			<me>
				S = \left\{\text{spring, summer, fall, winter} \right\}.
			</me>
			By classifying items as groups (sets), we can also investigate relationships between groups, or consider overlap between groups when counting items.
		</p>
		<definition>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>set</term> is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called the <term>elements</term> (or <term>members</term>) of the set.
				</p>
			</statement>

		<title>Set Notation</title>
		<p>
			A set can be defined by describing the contents, or by listing the elements of the set, enclosed in curly brackets. Symbolically, sets are represented using capital letters and braces { } are used to enclose the sets elements. 
			The method of listing the elements of a set in braces is called <term>roster</term> notation. A second method is to use <term>set-builder notation</term>, where braces and a vertical line | (read <q>such that</q>) is used to describe the contents of a set.
		</p>
		<example>
			<p>
				Describing a set by its contents:
				<ol marker="a)">
					<li>
						<p>
							The set of all even numbers.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The seasons of the year
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				Roster notation:
				<ol marker="a)">
					<li>
						<p>
							<m>E = \{0,2,4,6,8\}</m>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<m>C = \{\text{red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple} \}</m>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				Set builder notation:
				<ol marker="a)">
					<li>
						<p>
							<m>S = \{x \mid x \text{ is a student at WWU}\}</m>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<m>E = \{x \mid 2x \text{ is a whole number} \}</m>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</example>
		<example>
			<statement>
			<p>
				Julia, Keenan, Jae and Colin took a test. They got the following scores: 70, 95, 85 and 70. Let <m>P</m> be the set of test takers and <m>S</m> be the set of test scores. List the elements of each set using set notation.
			</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					In this example, the set of people taking the test is <m>P= \{\text{Julia, Keenan, Jae, Colin}\}</m>, and the set of test scores is <m>S = \{70, 85, 95\}</m>. Notice in this example that even though two people scored a 70 on the test, the score of 70 is only listed once.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			Sometimes a collection might not contain all the elements of a set.  For example, suppose Chris owns three Madonna albums.  While Chris's collection is a set, we can also say it is a subset of the larger set of all Madonna albums.
		</p>
		<definition>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two sets. Then <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m>, written <m>A\subseteq B</m>, if and only if every element of <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<definition>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two sets. We say that <m>A</m> is a <term>equal</term> to <m>B</m>, written <m>A = B</m>, if and only if <m>A\subseteq B</m> and <m>B\subseteq A</m>. That is, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> contain the same elements.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<example>
			<p>
				Consider the three sets
				<me>
					A = \{1,2,3\},\quad B = \{1,2,3,4,5\},\quad C = \{3,2,1\}.
				</me>
				Then each of the following set relationships is true:
				<ol marker="a)">
					<li>
						<p><m>A \subseteq B</m></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><m>A = C</m></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><m>A \subseteq C</m></p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</example>
		<p>
			It is possible to have a set with nothing in it. This set called the <term>null set</term> or <term>empty set</term>. It is like going to the grocery store to buy your favorite foods and realizing you left your wallet at home. 
			You walk away with an empty bag. The set of items that you bought at the grocery store would written in set notation as <m>\emptyset</m>. The empty set is a subset of every set.
		</p>
		<p>
			In applications of sets the elements that may be considered are often limited to some context or <term>universe of discourse</term>. This context is called the <term>universal set</term> and is the set containing every possible element of the described context. Every set is thus a subset of the universal set. The universal set is often labeled with a capital letter <m>U</m>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When represented visually, the universal set is often illustrated by a rectangle labeled with a capital letter <em>U</em>. Subsets of the universal set are usually illustrated with circles for simplicity, but other shapes can be used. The visual representation of sets is further discussed in <xref text="title" ref="subsec-sets-Venn-diagrams"/>.
		</p>
		<definition>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The set that contains no elements is called the <term>empty set</term> and is denoted <m>\emptyset</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<definition>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>universal set</term> <m>U</m> is defined to be the set of all elements under consideration.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<example>
			<p>
				What contents of the universal set depends on context and is sometime subject to interpretation. Here are some examples.

		<title>Venn Diagrams</title>
		<p>
			<term>Venn diagrams</term> are used to illustrate the relationships between two or more sets. To create a Venn diagram, start by drawing a rectangle to represent the universal set. Next draw and label overlapping circles to represent each of your sets. Most often there will be two or three sets illustrated in a Venn diagram. Finally, if you are given elements, fill in each region with its corresponding elements. Venn diagrams are also a great way to illustrate intersections, unions and complements of sets as shown below.
