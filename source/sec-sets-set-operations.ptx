  <introduction>
    <p>
      The idea of a <term>set</term> allows us to treat distinct objects as a single entity. For example, we could use <m>S</m> to represent the four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter.  That is,
      <me>
        S = \left\{\text{spring, summer, fall, winter} \right\}.
      </me>
      By classifying items as groups (sets), we can also investigate relationships between groups, or consider overlap between groups when counting items.

          A <term>set</term> is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called the <term>elements</term> (or <term>members</term>) of the set.
