	<introduction>
		<p>
			Now that we have learned about sets and counting techniques, we are ready to talk about <term>probability</term>. Probability is something we use in many different ways in everyday life. Consider the following examples.
			<ul>
				<li><p>A weather forecaster predicts that there is a 20% chance of rain tomorrow.</p></li>
				<li><p>A news cast predicts that the probability a ballot measure will pass is 60%.</p></li>
				<li><p>The lottery introduces a new scratch ticket in which the odds of winning are 1 in 200.</p></li>
			</ul>
			In each of these cases, we are measuring how likely a certain event is to take place. This is probability.
