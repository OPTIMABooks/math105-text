	<introduction>
		<p>
			Now that we have learned about sets and counting techniques, we are ready to talk about <term>probability</term>. Probability is something we use in many different ways in everyday life. Consider the following examples.
			<ul>
				<li><p>A weather forecaster predicts that there is a 20% chance of rain tomorrow.</p></li>
				<li><p>A news cast predicts that the probability a ballot measure will pass is 60%.</p></li>
				<li><p>The lottery introduces a new scratch ticket in which the odds of winning are 1 in 200.</p></li>
			</ul>
			In each of these cases, we are measuring how likely a certain event is to take place. This is probability.

			<statement>
				<p>
					<term>Probability</term> is the branch of mathematics that studies possible outcomes of events, their relative likelihoods, and how they are distributed.

			Probabilities calculated from counting data or simulated results are known as <term>experimental probabilities</term>. In contrast, when the likelihood (or chance) of an event is determined by analyzing all the possible outcomes and calculating the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, it is referred to as a <term>theoretical probability</term>. A third type of probability, called <term>subjective probability</term>, is essentially an educated guess based on personal experience or intuition. This section will primarily focus on theoretical probabilities.
