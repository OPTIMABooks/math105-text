	<introduction>
		<p>
			Now that we have learned about sets and counting techniques, we are ready to talk about <term>probability</term>. Probability is something we use in many different ways in everyday life. Consider the following examples.
			<ul>
				<li><p>A weather forecaster predicts that there is a 20% chance of rain tomorrow.</p></li>
				<li><p>A news cast predicts that the probability a ballot measure will pass is 60%.</p></li>
				<li><p>The lottery introduces a new scratch ticket in which the odds of winning are 1 in 200.</p></li>
			</ul>
			In each of these cases, we are measuring how likely a certain event is to take place. This is probability.

		<title>Theoretical Probability</title>
		<p>
			Probabilities calculated from counting data or simulated results are known as <term>experimental probabilities</term>. In contrast, when the likelihood (or chance) of an event is determined by analyzing all the possible outcomes and calculating the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, it is referred to as a <term>theoretical probability</term>. A third type of probability, called <term>subjective probability</term>, is essentially an educated guess based on personal experience or intuition. This section will primarily focus on theoretical probabilities.

			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>theoretical probability</term> of a certain event <m>E</m> happening in an experiment is found by counting the number of possible outcomes of the experiment in which <m>E</m> happens and dividing by the total number of outcomes, assuming each outcome is equally likely. That is:
					<me>
						P(E)=\frac{\text{number of outcomes corresponding to the event E}}{\text{total number of equally-likely outcomes}}

		<title>Basic Probability Rules</title>
		<p>
			Before we can discuss the basic rules of probability, it is important to understand the terminology used. The terms we need to define are rooted in <em>sets</em>, which we discussed earlier in this chapter.  First, we need to define what we mean by an <term>experiment</term> in probability theory.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def-experiment_probability">
			<statement>
				<p>
					An <term>experiment</term> or <term>trial</term> is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes, known as the <term>sample space</term>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			The following example illustrates key terms.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_probabilty_basic-rules_coin-flip">
			<title>Analyzing a Simple Experiment</title>
			<p>
				A fair coin is flipped twice, and the number of heads is noted. What is the probability that exactly one heads appears in these two flips?
			</p>
			<p>
				The <term>experiment</term> here is a coin toss. This experiment has the possible outcomes of the coin landing on <q>heads</q> or <q>tails</q>. This set of possible outcomes is called the <term>sample space</term> and typically named <m>S</m>.  We write the sample space as
				<me>
					S = \lbrace HH, HT, TH, TT \rbrace
				</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second set needed is the set containing all of the outcomes from <m>S</m> which meet our criterion of having exactly one heads. Any <xref ref="def-subset" text="custom">subset</xref> of the sample space is called an <term>event</term>.  For this problem, the event is
				<me>
					E = \lbrace HT, TH \rbrace
				</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we assume that each of the outcomes is equally likely, then (applying <xref ref="def_theoretical-probability"/>)
				<me>
					P(E) = \frac{ n(E)}{n(S)} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.50
				</me>.
			</p>
		</example>
		<definition xml:id="def_sample-space">
			<idx>sample space</idx>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>sample space</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>sample space</term> for an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
				<example xml:id="ex_probability_basic-rules-2">
			<statement>
				<p>
					An experiment consists of rolling two fair die and noting the sum of the numbers rolled. Below are several sets related to this experiment.
					<ol label="a.">
						<li><p><m>\lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 , 11, 12 \rbrace</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>\lbrace 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 \rbrace</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>\lbrace (1,1), (1,2), ... , (5,6), (6,6) \rbrace</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>\lbrace 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \rbrace</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>\lbrace 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 \rbrace</m></p></li>
					</ol>
					Which of these sets is the sample space of the experiment?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<answer><p>the set in (d) gives the possible sums.</p></answer>
		</example>
		<definition xml:id="def_event">
			<idx>event</idx>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>event</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					An <term>event</term> for a particular experiment is a subset of the sample space for that experiment.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			In <xref ref="ex_probabilty_basic-rules_coin-flip"/>, the event of interest was <m>E = \lbrace HT, TH \rbrace</m>. Notice that every outcome in that event is also an outcome in the sample space <m>S</m>. This is what it means to say that <m>E</m> is a <idx><h>sets</h><h>subset</h></idx><term>subset</term> of <m>S</m>. 
			Also notice that because <m>E</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>, it must always be true that <m>E</m> contains at most the same number of elements as <m>S</m>. That is, <m>n(E) \leq n(S)</m>. This, together with our definition of <xref ref="def_theoretical-probability" text="custom">theoretical probability</xref>, leads to the following rules.
		</p>
		<fact xml:id="thm_basic-probability">
			<title>Basic Probability Rules</title>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>formula</h><h>basic rules</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>For any event <m>E</m> in a sample space <m>S</m>, the following rules must hold.
				  <ul cols="2">
				  	<li><p><m>0 \leq P(E) \leq 1</m></p></li>
				  	<li><p><m>P(S) = 1</m></p></li>
				  </ul>
				</p>
			</statement>
		</fact>
		<p>
			The first rule says that because <m>E</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>, the ratio of <m>n(E)</m> to <m>n(S)</m> can be at most one, and as with any ratio, must be at least 0. 
			The second rule tells us that the probability of something in the sample space happening is 1. Since the sample space contains all possible outcomes, this gives us the maximum possible probability of 1.
