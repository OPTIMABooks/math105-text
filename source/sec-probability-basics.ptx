	<introduction>
		<p>
			Now that we have learned about sets and counting techniques, we are ready to talk about <term>probability</term>. Probability is something we use in many different ways in everyday life. Consider the following examples.
			<ul>
				<li><p>A weather forecaster predicts that there is a 20% chance of rain tomorrow.</p></li>
				<li><p>A news cast predicts that the probability a ballot measure will pass is 60%.</p></li>
				<li><p>The lottery introduces a new scratch ticket in which the odds of winning are 1 in 200.</p></li>
			</ul>
			In each of these cases, we are measuring how likely a certain event is to take place. This is probability.

			<statement>
				<p>
					<term>Probability</term> is the branch of mathematics that studies possible outcomes of events, their relative likelihoods, and how they are distributed.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			Probabilities calculated from counting data or simulated results are known as <term>experimental probabilities</term>. In contrast, when the likelihood (or chance) of an event is determined by analyzing all the possible outcomes and calculating the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, it is referred to as a <term>theoretical probability</term>. A third type of probability, called <term>subjective probability</term>, is essentially an educated guess based on personal experience or intuition. This section will primarily focus on theoretical probabilities.

		<title>Basic Probability Rules</title>
		<p>
			Before we can discuss the basic rules of probability, it is important to understand the terminology used. The terms we need to define are rooted in <em>sets</em>, which we discussed earlier in this chapter.  Consider the following example.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_probabilty_basic-rules_coin-flip">
			<title>Analyzing a Simple Experiment</title>
			<p>
				A fair coin is flipped twice, and the number of heads is noted. What is the probability that exactly one heads appears in these two flips?
			</p>
			<p>
				To better understand this question, let's look at two important sets. The first set is called the <term>sample space</term> and typically named <m>S</m>. <m>S</m> contains all of the possible outcomes of this experiment.  That is,
				<me>
					S = \lbrace HH, HT, TH, TT \rbrace
				</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second set is the set containing all of the outcomes from <m>S</m> which meet our criteria of having exactly one heads. Any <xref ref="def-subset" text="custom">subset</xref> of the sample space is called an <term>event</term>.  For this problem, the event of interest is:
				<me>
					E = \lbrace HT, TH \rbrace
				</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we assume that each of the outcomes is equally likely, then 
				<me>
					P(E) = \frac{ n(E)}{n(S)} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.50
				</me>.
			</p>
		</example>
		<p>In the example above, two sets are described, and their names are particularly important.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_sample-space">
			<idx>sample space</idx>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>sample space</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>sample space</term> for an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<definition xml:id="def_event">
			<idx>event</idx>
			<idx><h>probability</h><h>event</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					An <term>event</term> for a particular experiment is a subset of the sample space for that experiment.
				</p>
			</statement>
