			<p>
				Once we have collected data from an observational study or an experiment, we need to summarize and present it in a way that will be meaningful to our audience. Raw <term>data</term> is not very useful by itself. In this section we will begin with graphical presentations of data and in the rest of the chapter we will learn about numerical summaries of data.
			</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_data">
				<idx>data</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Any collection of measurements or values is referred to collectively as <term>data</term>.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>
				We can understand and classify data better if we first understand the source from which the measurements are taken. Each type of measurement such as height, length of time, or favorite pizza topping, comes from a certain characteristic or property called a <term>variable</term>.
			</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_variable">
				<idx>variable</idx>
				<statement>
					<p>
						A <term>variable</term> is a single characteristic that is being measured or changed.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>
				In a typical set of data, one or more variables are identified, and the measurements are collected for each of those variables.
			</p>
			<example xml:id="ex_data_identifying-variables">
				<!-- <title>Identifying Variables</title> -->
				<statement>
					<p>
						A wildlife conservationist wishes to better understand the population of fish that live in a certain lake. To do this, she catches 100 fish and records the species, length, and weight of each fish. What are the variables in this set of data?
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						The three characteristics measured are: fish species, fish length, and fish weight. These are the variables.

			<title>Classification by Number of Variables</title>
			<p>
				One way in which we can classify data is based on the number of variables that are being measured. In this chapter we may look at data sets composed of	measurements from one, two, or more variables. These are given the following names.
			</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_num-vars">
				<idx><h>data</h><h>univariate</h></idx>
				<idx><h>data</h><h>bivariate</h></idx>
				<idx><h>data</h><h>multivariate</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>
						A data set can be named based on the number of variables being measured as follows.
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<term>Univariate data</term> contains measurements from a single variable.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<term>Bivariate data</term> contains measurements from two variables. This is sometimes called <term>paired data</term>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<term>Multivariate data</term> contains measurements from three or more variables.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>
				Let's look at an example.
			</p>
			<example xml:id="ex_data_classifying-datasets">
				<!-- <title>Classifying Datasets</title> -->
				<statement>
					<p>
						Identify each of the following data sets based on the number of variables being measured.
						<ol marker="a.">
							<li>
								<p>
									A wildlife conservationist records the species, length, and weight of 100 fish caught in a certain lake.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									To better understand how tall tomato plants grow, you record the height of 40 tomato plants at a local nursery.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									The mayor wants to know if the local bond measure will pass in the next election. He asks 250 city residents how old they are, and if they plan to support the measure.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									As a part of the admission process, a school requires students to submit their name, phone number, zip code, email address, and expected major.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						<ol marker="a.">
							<li>
								<p>
									Multivariate. There are three variables: species, length, and weight.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Univariate. Since there is only one variable, height, this is univariate data.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Bivariate. Collecting age and support for the bond means that there are two variables.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Multivariate. There are five variables in this data set, so it must be multivariate.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</solution>

			<title>Types of Variable</title>
			<p>
				Another way to classify data is based on the types of variables that are being measured. The type of a variable depends on what is being recorded. Consider the following example.
			</p>
			<example xml:id="ex_data_classify-variables">
				<title>Classifying Variables</title>
				<statement>
					<p> 
						The post office, wishing to better understand its customers, decides to collect	data from 1000 households in eastern Washington. They mail each household a questionnaire asking the residents to confirm their zip code, list the number of people who live in that household, and give the length of time that they have lived there. What are the variables in this study, and how do the measurements differ?
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						The three variables in this multivariate set of data are: zip code, number of residents, and length of time in residence. The characteristics of these variables are:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<title>Zip Code</title>
								<p>
									While the values recorded are numbers (i.e. 99324, 49103, 92357, etc) they
									actually represent categories and not numerical values. Notice that it would 
									make no sense to <q>average</q> or add together two zip codes!
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<title>Number of Residents</title>
								<p>
									These values are numbers (i.e. 2 residents, 5 residents, 1 resident, etc) and they do actually represent numerical quantities. Notice that it does make sense to talk about the <q>average number of residents</q> or to perform mathematical operations on these values. Also, note that the values that this variable can take on are all whole numbers.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<title>Length of Residence</title>
								<p>
									The values for this final variable are also numbers (i.e. 1 year, 2 months, and 12 days = 1.2 years). It also makes sense to perform mathematical operation on these values. In contracts to the <q>number or residence</q> data, these values can be decimals or fractions.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>
				The example above illustrates the two main types of variables we will study. One example of the first type is <q>zip code</q>, a variable that yields non-numerical data. The values of such a variable represent categories into which individuals can be grouped, or <q>qualities</q> that the data possess. Such variables are called <term>qualitative</term>.
			</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_qualitative-variable">
				<idx>qualitative variable</idx>
				<idx><h>variable</h><h>qualitative</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>
						A <term>qualitative variable</term> (also called a <term>categorical variable</term>) is one that takes on values representing categories or descriptions as opposed to numerical values.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			<p>
				The second type of variable<mdash/>and the one we will focus on most in this chapter<mdash/>includes variables whose values are numerical and can be used in mathematical operations such as addition and division. These values represent a <q>quantity</q> rather than a <q>quality</q>, and are therefore called <term>quantitative</term> variables. Examples of this type from our earlier example include <q>number of residents</q> and <q>length of residence</q>.
			</p>
			<definition xml:id="def_quantitative-variable">
				<idx>quantitative variable</idx>
				<idx><h>variable</h><h>quantitative</h></idx>
				<statement>
					<p>
						A <term>quantitative variable</term> is one that takes on numerical values. Unlike a qualitative variable, the values of a quantitative variable can be used in computations.
					</p>
				</statement>
