      The git log for this book contains granular attribution of sources. In broad strokes, the Finance and Logical Reasoning chapters draw heavily from Lee et al. In particular, the sections on Income Taxes and Logical Fallacies are brought over from Lee et al with only brief edits or corrections, as are any provided exercises in this text.  Lee et al. was itself in part derived from Lippman's work; in places I have used the original source material rather than their adaptation. The sections on sets contain material from Sekhom and Bloom as well as Duncan. The sections on Probability and Statistics draw heavily on Duncan's work.

      <title> Thanks</title>
      <p>
        I thank the authors listed above for their work and for making it public. Without them, this project would not have been completed in the time I had to work on it. I have freely edited, extended, and adapted these sources. Any mistakes are no doubt mine!
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I want to thank <url href="https://www.wallawalla.edu/" visual="pcc.edu/math-in-society">Walla Walla University</url> for awarding me a sabbatical during Spring Quarter of 2025 to work on this project. This book would not have been possible without relief from both my teaching and administrative duties.
