    Counting is a core idea in mathematics, practiced since the dawn of history. Finite sets, with a specific number of distinct elements, are essential to this process. When dealing with two or three sets, we track elements that occur in multiple sets. Set operations—intersections, unions, and complements—are crucial tools for solving these counting problems.
