	<title>Measures of Center</title>

	<objectives>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Describe the <q>center</q> of a data set using the mean, mode, and median, and describe the strengths and weaknesses of each of these measures.

	<introduction>
		<p>
			In addition to graphical and verbal descriptions, we can use numerical summaries to better understand quantitative distributions by examining where the data is centered and how spread out the values are. Together, measures of center and spread provide important information for estimating population parameters. This section focuses on measures of center, while the next will address measures of spread. We will begin by exploring three common ways to describe the center of a distribution: the mode, median, and mean, each suited to different situations.

		<title>The Mode</title>
		<p>
			We have already seen the term <term>mode</term> used in the context of a graph. Recall that the <xref ref="def_histogram-mode" text="custom">mode of a histogram or bar graph</xref> is the class or category that has the tallest bar. That is, it is the class or category that appears the most in the data set. This seems to be a reasonable way to describe a <q>typical</q> element of a data set and leads to the following definition.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_mode">
			<idx>mode</idx>
			<idx><h>measures of center</h><h>mode</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>mode</term> of a set of values is the value that appears most often. If more than one value is tied for the most appearances, each one is a mode. If no value appears more than once, there is no mode.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			The <term>mode</term> is unique among our measures of center as it is the only one that applies to both <xref ref="def_quantitative-variable" text="custom">quantitative variables</xref> and <xref ref="def_qualitative-variable" text="custom">qualitative variables</xref>. Consider the following examples.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_center-spread_mode-qualitative">
			<!-- <title>The Mode of a Qualitative Variable</title> -->
			<statement>
				<p>
					A breakout presentation at a business convention attracts 16 participants. The job title of each of these participants is as follows. Find the mode of this set of data.
				</p>
				<table xml:id="ex_center-spread_mode-qualitative_data">
					<title>Job Titles</title>
					<tabular>
						<row>
							<cell>manager</cell>
							<cell>owner</cell>
							<cell>H.R. director</cell>
							<cell>owner</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>manager</cell>
							<cell>H.R. director</cell>
							<cell>manager</cell>
							<cell>manager</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>owner</cell>
							<cell>manager</cell>
							<cell>manager</cell>
							<cell>H.R. director</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell>manager</cell>
							<cell>owner</cell>
							<cell>owner</cell>
							<cell>manager</cell>
						</row>
					</tabular>
				</table>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The mode is the most commonly appearing value. One way to find that is to construct a <xref ref="def_frequency-table" text="custom">frequency table</xref>.  Doing so for this data produces the following table, from which we can see that the mode is <q>manager</q>.
				</p>
				<table xml:id="ex_center-spread_mode_frequency-table">
					<title>Frequency Table</title>
					<tabular>
						<row bottom="medium">
							<cell right="medium">Value</cell>
							<cell>Frequency</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell right="medium">manager</cell>
							<cell>8</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell right="medium">H.R. director</cell>
							<cell>3</cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell right="medium">owner</cell>
							<cell>5</cell>
						</row>
