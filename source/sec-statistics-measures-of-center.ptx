	<introduction>
		<p>
			In addition to graphical and verbal descriptions, we can use numerical summaries to better understand quantitative distributions by examining where the data is centered and how spread out the values are. Together, measures of center and spread provide important information for estimating population parameters. This section focuses on measures of center, while the next will address measures of spread. We will begin by exploring three common ways to describe the center of a distribution: the mode, median, and mean, each suited to different situations.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<subsection xml:id="subsec_center-spread_mode">
		<title>Mode</title>
		<p>
			We have already seen the term <term>mode</term> used in the context of a graph. Recall that the <xref ref="def_histogram-mode" text="custom">mode of a histogram or bar graph</xref> is the class or category that has the tallest bar. That is, it is the class or category that appears the most in the data set. This seems to be a reasonable way to describe a <q>typical</q> element of a data set and leads to the following definition.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_mode">
			<idx>mode</idx>
			<idx><h>measures of center</h><h>mode</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>mode</term> of a set of values is the value that appears most often. If more than one value is tied for the most appearances, each one is a mode. If no value appears more than once, there is no mode.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			The <term>mode</term> is unique among our measures of center as it is the only one that applies to both <xref ref="def_quantitative-variable" text="custom">quantitative variables</xref> and <xref ref="def_qualitative-variable" text="custom">qualitative variables</xref>. Consider the following examples.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_center-spread_mode-qualitative">
			<!-- <title>The Mode of a Qualitative Variable</title> -->
			<statement>
				<p>
					A breakout presentation at a business convention attracts 16 participants. The job title of each of these participants is as follows. Find the mode of this set of data.

					The mode is the most commonly appearing value. One way to find that is to construct a <xref ref="def_frequency-table" text="custom">frequency table</xref>.  Doing so for this data produces the following table, from which we can see that the mode is <q>manager</q>.

					Notice that in this data set, both the 5 and the 3 appear three times. Every other value appears two or fewer times. This makes this set of data bimodal with modes 3 and 5.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			While the mode is an easy way to measure the center, and is in fact the only way we have to measure the center of a set of qualitative data, it is usually not the best choice for measuring the center of a set of quantitative data. To see why this may be so, consider the next example.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_center-spread_mode_bad-example">
			<statement>
				<p>Find the mode of the following sets of numbers.
					<ol marker="a.">
						<li><p><m>\lbrace 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 19, 22, 50 \rbrace</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>\lbrace 1, 1, 20, 23, 26, 24, 29, 30, 27, 32, 19\rbrace</m></p></li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The modes of these sets of numbers are as follows:
					<ol marker="a">
						<li>
							<p>
								This data set contains no repeated values. Therefore, according to <xref ref="def_mode" text="custom">the definition</xref>, there is no mode for this set.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								This data contains only one repeated value, the 1. So the mode is 1. However, 1 is definitely not the <q>typical</q> value in the set since all other values are between 19 and 32.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			In summary, you should use the mode to measure the center of any qualitative set of data, or as a quick, but not definitive, measure of center for quantitative data. But be careful! The mode may not exist, there may be multiple modes, and if there is a single mode it may be very different from the <q>typical</q> values in the data set.
		</p>

	<subsection xml:id="subsec_center-midrange">
		<title>Midrange</title>
		<p>
			When we think of the <q>typical</q> value in a set of data, we may also think of the word <term>middle</term>. Our next measure of center, the <term>midrange</term>, is exactly that<mdash/>the middle of the data set. Note that the midrange is not a very useful measure of center. Rather, we introduce it in order to discuss <term>outliers</term> and why some measures of center are more appropriate than others depending on characteristics of the data.

					To find the midrange and range we need to identify the maximum and minimum values in the data set. The largest value is 18.3 and the smallest is 6.5, Thus we compute the midrange using:
					<me>
						\text{midrange} = \frac{18.3+6.5}{2} = 12.4
					</me>.
					It looks like the pond is not yet ready to open for fishing. The typical fish, as measured by the midrange, is only 12.4 inches long and could not be kept.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			The midrange is useful for measuring the center of a dataset, but it has significant limitations. Most importantly, the midrange is extremely sensitive to <term>outliers</term>. Additionally, it only considers the maximum and minimum values, ignoring all other data points. Ideally, a measure of center should incorporate every value in the dataset when determining the <q>typical</q> value.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_outlier">
			<idx>outlier</idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					An <term>outlier</term> in a data set is a value that is either much larger than the rest of the data or much smaller than the rest of the data.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			To see how an outlier can affect the midrange, let's take another look at the fish-length data from the previous example.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_center-spread_midrange_computation-outlier">
			<!-- <title>The Effect of Outliers on the Midrange and Range</title> -->
			<statement>
				<p>
					The game warden believes that the 6.5 inch fish she caught in the <xref ref="ex_center-spread_midrange_computation_data" text="custom">sample above</xref> is an outlier. She decides to redo the computation without that fish. Find the new midrange.</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Without the 6.5 inch outlier, the new minimum is 8.7. This gives the following values:
					<me>
						\text{midrange} = \frac{18.3+8.7}{2} = 13.5
					</me>.
					With this new computation, it looks like the fish are in fact large enough to be caught<mdash/>the typical fish length, as measured by the midrange, is 13.5 inches.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			Notice what a big difference the single 6.5 inch fish made! This is what we mean when we say that the midrange is sensitive to outliers.
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection xml:id="sec_center-spread_median">
		<title>Median</title>
		<p>
			To reinforce why we need a measure of center that is resistant to outliers, consider the following example.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_center-spread_median_outlier">
			<p>
				The most expensive house in a certain market is a $2,500,000.00 mansion. The least expensive house is an $8,000.00 mobile home. Do you think that the midrange is an accurate measure of the <q>typical</q> home value in this market?
			</p>
			<p>
				To answer this question, let's first compute the midrange. This is:
				<me>
					\text{midrange} = \frac{2500000 + 8000}{2} = 1254000.
				</me>
				Do you think that the typical house really costs one and a quarter million dollars? Probably not! The midrange <em>is not an appropriate measure of center</em> for this data.
			</p>
		</example>
		<p>
			As we saw before, the outliers in this data set are affecting the midrange. To address these limitations, we need a measure of center that is resistant to outliers and uses more than just the extreme values.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_median">
			<idx>median</idx>
			<idx><h>measures of center</h><h>median</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>median</term> of a data set is the middle number, or average of the two middle numbers, in the set of data once it has been arranged in increasing order.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			You may have heard of the <term>median</term>, a common measure of center that's especially useful when a data set includes outliers, such as housing prices or household incomes. The term <q>median household income</q> is often used because it reflects typical earnings more accurately in such cases. This is especially helpful in places like Washington State, where billionaires like Bill Gates can skew the data. Let's practice finding the median.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_center-spread_median">
			<!-- <title>Computing the Median</title> -->
			<statement>
				<p>Find the median of each set of data below.
					<ol marker="a.">
						<li>
							<p>
								<m>\lbrace 14, 17, 10, 9, 16, 19, 12, 10, 15, 13 \rbrace</m>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<m>\lbrace 100, 215, 164, 117, 1000, 205, 178 \rbrace</m>
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					There are two steps to computing the median, and it is important that we do step one first. That first step is to arrange the data in order. The second step is to locate the middle value. Let's try this on both of the data sets above. 
					<ol marker="a.">
						<li>
							<p>
								Our first step is to re-arrange this set of numbers in order, from smallest to largest:
								<me>
									\lbrace 9, 10, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19\rbrace
								</me>
								Then we find the middle number. Since there are an even number of values (ten of them), the exact middle lies half way between the two center values (5th and 6th) which are 13 and 14. So the median is <m>\frac{13+14}{2} = 13.5</m>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Again, we start by ordering the data:
								<me>
									\lbrace 100, 117, 164, 178, 205, 215, 1000 \rbrace
								</me>
								As there are an odd number of values in this data set (seven of them), the median is the single value in the exact center (the 4th value), which is 178.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			Notice that the 1000 in the second data set is an outlier. But when finding the median, the actual value doesn't matter<mdash/>only its position in the data set does. You could replace 1000 with a more typical number like 220, and the median would stay the same. Bill Gates could earn just $200,000 a year, and the median household income in Washington State wouldn't change! This is what it means for the median to be <em>resistant to outliers</em>.
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection xml:id="subsec_center-spread_mean">
		<title>Mean</title>
		<p>
			While the median effectively handles outliers, it has one significant limitation: it ignores the values of individual data points. When we want each value to influence our measure of center, we use the <term>arithmetic mean</term> (commonly called the average). Unlike the median, the arithmetic mean incorporates every data point in the dataset. For a sample, we use <m>\overline{x}</m> (read <q>x bar</q>) to represent the mean.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_mean">
			<idx>mean</idx>
			<idx><h>measures of center</h><h>mean</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>arithmetic mean</term>, which we will call simply the <term>mean</term>, is a measure of center found by taking the sum of all values in the data set and dividing by the number of values in the data set. Symbolically,
					<me>
						\bar{x}=\frac{\text{sum of data values}}{n}
					</me>,
					where <m>n</m> is the number of values in the data set.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			The term <term>arithmetic mean</term> is important for two reasons. First, we avoid calling it the average because <q>average</q> simply means <q>typical,</q> and there are multiple ways to measure what's typical. Second, we specify <em>arithmetic</em> mean because other types of means exist, though we don't cover them here.
		</p>
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Mirabel's exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, and 94. What is her mean test score?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					To find the mean test score we need to find the sum of her test scores, then divide the sum by the number of test scores (<m>n=4</m>). The mean is:
				</p>
				<p>
					<me>\bar{x}=\frac{79+86+82+94}{4}=85.25\text{ points}</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice that the mean has the same units as the data and that it is important to label it.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			It is reasonable to calculate the mean by hand when working with a small data set. However, if the data set is large or if you plan to compute additional statistics, using technology is a more efficient choice. Ask your instructor how to approach these types of problems. That said, when a large data set with repeated values is organized in a frequency table, it can still be practical to perform the calculation by hand as shown in the next example.
		</p>
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					One hundred families from a particular neighborhood are randomly selected and asked to give their annual household income rounded to the nearest $5,000. The results are shown in the frequency table below. Find the mean annual income for this neighborhood.

			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Calculating the mean by hand could get tedious if we try to type in all 100 values:
					<me>
						\bar{x}=\frac{\overbrace{15+ \cdot + 15}^{6 \text{ terms}} + \overbrace{20+ \cdot + 20}^{8 \text{ terms}} +\cdots+ \overbrace{50 + \cdot + 50}^{7 \text{ terms}}}{100}
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					However, we can calculate this easily using multiplication top deal with repeated values. Doing so, the sum of the data values (the numerator of the mean) is
					<md>
						<mrow> \amp (15)(6)+(20)(8) + (25)(11)+(30)(17)</mrow>
						<mrow> \amp +(35)(19)+(40)(20) +(45)(21)+(50)(7) </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp= 3390 </mrow>
					</md>.
					The mean is then
					<me>\bar{x}=\frac{3390}{100}=33.9</me>
					That is, the mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars or $33,900.

				<ul>
					<li>
						<title>Mode</title>

			<!-- <title>Picking Appropriate Measures</title> -->
			<statement>
				<p>
					Determine which measure of center would be best in each of the following data sets.
					<ol marker="a.">
						<li>
							<p>
								The salaries of all employee's at IBM.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								A quick assessment of how well a group of athletes did in a 100-meter dash.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Determine the typical hair color in a group of teenagers.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Finding the typical height of a pine tree in a given acre of forest.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					<ol marker="a.">
						<li>
							<p>
								Salaries of all employees at a large firm such as IBM are likely to include outliers, such as the CEO's salary. For this reason, the median is probably the best measure of center.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The midrange may be best. This set of data should not include many outliers, and the values will be small and relatively close together. This makes the midrange an acceptable way to quickly measure the center.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Hair color is a qualitative variable, so our only choice is to use the mode.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Pine tree heights on an acre of forest land should not have large outliers, and there are likely to be quite a few trees. Since there is no reason to use any of the other measures of center, the mean would be best here.

			Often it is helpful to compute several summaries so that they can be compared ton one another. One useful comparison relates the mean and median together. When the mean is larger than the median, the data will have a histogram that is <xref ref="def_histogram-symmetry" text="custom">skewed right</xref>. When the mean is smaller, the histogram will be <xref ref="def_histogram-symmetry" text="custom">skewed left</xref>.  Finally, if the mean and median are equal, the histogram will be approximately <xref ref="def_histogram-symmetry" text="custom">symmetric</xref>.
