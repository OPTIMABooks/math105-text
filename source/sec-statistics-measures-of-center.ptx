	<title>Measures of Center</title>

	<objectives>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			In addition to graphical and verbal descriptions, we can use numerical summaries to better understand quantitative distributions by examining where the data is centered and how spread out the values are. Together, measures of center and spread provide important information for estimating population parameters. This section focuses on measures of center, while the next will address measures of spread. We will begin by exploring three common ways to describe the center of a distribution: the mode, median, and mean, each suited to different situations.

	<subsection xml:id="sec_center-spread_mode">
		<title>The Mode</title>
		<p>
			We have already seen the term <term>mode</term> used in the context of a graph. Recall that the <xref ref="def_histogram-mode" text="custom">mode of a histogram or bar graph</xref> is the class or category that has the tallest bar. That is, it is the class or category that appears the most in the data set. This seems to be a reasonable way to describe a <q>typical</q> element of a data set and leads to the following definition.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_mode">
			<idx>mode</idx>
			<idx><h>measures of center</h><h>mode</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>mode</term> of a set of values is the value that appears most often. If more than one value is tied for the most appearances, each one is a mode. If no value appears more than once, there is no mode.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			The <term>mode</term> is unique among our measures of center as it is the only one that applies to both <xref ref="def_quantitative-variable" text="custom">quantitative variables</xref> and <xref ref="def_qualitative-variable" text="custom">qualitative variables</xref>. Consider the following examples.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_center-spread_mode-qualitative">
			<!-- <title>The Mode of a Qualitative Variable</title> -->
			<statement>
				<p>
					A breakout presentation at a business convention attracts 16 participants. The job title of each of these participants is as follows. Find the mode of this set of data.
				</p>
				<table xml:id="ex_center-spread_mode-qualitative_data">
					<title>Job titles</title>
					<tabular>

			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The mode is the most commonly appearing value. One way to find that is to construct a <xref ref="def_frequency-table" text="custom">frequency table</xref>.  Doing so for this data produces the following table, from which we can see that the mode is <q>manager</q>.
				</p>
				<table xml:id="ex_center-spread_mode_frequency-table">

				<p>
					Notice that in this data set, both the 5 and the 3 appear three times. Every other value appears two or fewer times. This makes this set of data bimodal with modes 3 and 5.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			While the mode is an easy way to measure the center, and is in fact the only way we have to measure the center of a set of qualitative data, it is usually not the best choice for measuring the center of a set of quantitative data. To see why this may be so, consider the next example.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_center-spread_mode_bad-example">
			<statement>
				<p>Find the mode of the following sets of numbers.
					<ol marker="a.">
						<li><p><m>\lbrace 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 19, 22, 50 \rbrace</m></p></li>
						<li><p><m>\lbrace 1, 1, 20, 23, 26, 24, 29, 30, 27, 32, 19\rbrace</m></p></li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The modes of these sets of numbers are as follows:
					<ol marker="a">
						<li>
							<p>
								This data set contains no repeated values. Therefore, according to <xref ref="def_mode" text="custom">the definition</xref>, there is no mode for this set.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								This data contains only one repeated value, the 1. So the mode is 1. However, 1 is definitely not the <q>typical</q> value in the set since all other values are between 19 and 32.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			In summary, you should use the mode to measure the center of any qualitative set of data, or as a quick, but not definitive, measure of center for quantitative data. But be careful! The mode may not exist, there may be multiple modes, and if there is a single mode it may be very different from the <q>typical</q> values in the data set.
