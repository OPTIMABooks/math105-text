			A measure of center such as the mean is not sufficient to numerically summarize the characteristics of a data set. To see why this is the case, consider the following three sets of quiz scores for a 10-point quiz.
		</p>
		<p>
			<alert>Section A:</alert>
		</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		<p>
			<alert>Section B:</alert>
		</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		<p>
			<alert>Section C:</alert>
		</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>4</cell>
				<cell>4</cell>

			Notice that all three data sets have a mean of 5 points and median of 5 points, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different from each other. In Section A, everyone had the same score; in Section B half the class earned no points and the other half got a perfect score. The scores for Section C are less consistent than the other sections but grouped closer to the central score of 5.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, in addition the measures of center, we also need a measure of how <q>spread out</q> (or <q>varied</q>, or <q>dispersed</q>) each data set is in order to characterize it well.  There are several ways to measure the variation of a distribution. In this section we will look at the <alert>range</alert>, <alert>interquartile range (IQR)</alert>, and <alert>standard deviation</alert>.

	<subsection xml:id="subsec-dispersion-range">
		<title>Range</title>
		<p>
			The simplest ways to quantify the spread of a data set is to compute the <term>range</term>. The range tells us the <q>width</q> of the entire data set by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum value.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_range">
			<idx>range</idx>
			<idx><h>measures of spread</h><h>range</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>range</term> of a set of data is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set. That is:
				<me>
					\text{range} = \text{maximum} - \text{minimum}
				</me>.
			</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			While simple to compute, the range is not a very useful measure of variation because it is heavily influenced by extreme values, or <xref ref="def_outlier" text="custom">outliers</xref>. For example, consider the distribution of full-time salaries in the United States. While many people earn near minimum wage, a few individuals<mdash/>such as CEOs of major corporations<mdash/>earn millions or even billions of dollars. This creates an enormous range that reveals little about where most salaries actually fall or how they are distributed around the typical (<q>center</q>) value.

			<statement>
				<p>
					A certain pond has been well stocked with fish for the upcoming fishing season. In order to keep a fish from this pond, it must be at least 13 inches long. To try to determine if the fish in the pond are long enough to allow fishing, a fish and game warden randomly catches and releases 20 different fish, finding the following lengths, in inches. Find the range of these data.

				<table xml:id="ex_center-spread_range_computation_data">

						</row>
					</tabular>
				</table>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					To find the range we need to identify the maximum and minimum values in the data set. The largest value is 18.3 and the smallest is 6.5, Thus the range is:
					<me>
						\text{range} = 18.3 - 6.5 = 11.8
					</me>.
					That is, the range in observed fish lengths is 11.8 inches.

		<title>Interquartile Range (IQR)</title>
	<p>
		Recall from the previous section that the <xref ref="def_median" text="custom">median</xref> is the most outlier-resistant measure of center. To create a similarly resistant measure of variation, we can extend the logic used to create the median. The median divides data into two halves. If we further divide each half at its median, we create four quarters (<term>quartiles</term>). 
		The <term>interquartile range (IQR)</term> measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data by finding the distance between the first quartile (<m>Q_1</m>) and third quartile (<m>Q_3</m>). Since the IQR excludes the extreme 25% of data on each end, it remains unaffected by outliers.
