	<introduction>

			A measure of center such as the mean is not sufficient to numerically summarize the characteristics of a data set. To see why this is the case, consider the following three sets of quiz scores for a 10-point quiz.
		</p>
		<p>
			<alert>Section A:</alert>
		</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		<p>
			<alert>Section B:</alert>
		</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		<p>
			<alert>Section C:</alert>
		</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>4</cell>
				<cell>4</cell>
				<cell>4</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>6</cell>
				<cell>6</cell>
				<cell>6</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		<p>
			Notice that all three data sets have a mean of 5 points and median of 5 points, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different from each other. In Section A, everyone had the same score; in Section B half the class earned no points and the other half got a perfect score. The scores for Section C are less consistent than the other sections but grouped closer to the central score of 5.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, in addition the measures of center, we also need a measure of how <q>spread out</q> (or <q>varied</q>, or <q>dispersed</q>) each data set is in order to characterize it well.  There are several ways to measure the variation of a distribution. In this section we will look at the <alert>range</alert>, <alert>interquartile range (IQR)</alert>, and <alert>standard deviation</alert>.

		<title>Range</title>
		<p>
			The simplest ways to quantify the spread of a data set is to compute the <term>range</term>. The range tells us the <q>width</q> of the entire data set by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum value.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_range">
			<idx>range</idx>
			<idx><h>measures of spread</h><h>range</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>range</term> of a set of data is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set. That is:
				<me>
					\text{range} = \text{maximum} - \text{minimum}
				</me>.
			</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>
			While simple to compute, the range is not a very useful measure of variation because it is heavily influenced by extreme values, or <xref ref="def_outlier" text="custom">outliers</xref>. For example, consider the distribution of full-time salaries in the United States. While many people earn near minimum wage, a few individuals<mdash/>such as CEOs of major corporations<mdash/>earn millions or even billions of dollars. This creates an enormous range that reveals little about where most salaries actually fall or how they are distributed around the typical (<q>center</q>) value.
