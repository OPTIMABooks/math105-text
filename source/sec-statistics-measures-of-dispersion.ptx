			A measure of center such as the mean is not sufficient to numerically summarize the characteristics of a data set. To see why this is the case, consider the following three sets of quiz scores for a 10-point quiz.
		</p>
		<p>
			<alert>Section A:</alert>
		</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		<p>
			<alert>Section B:</alert>
		</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>0</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		<p>
			<alert>Section C:</alert>
		</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row>
				<cell>4</cell>
				<cell>4</cell>
				<cell>4</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>5</cell>
				<cell>6</cell>
				<cell>6</cell>
				<cell>6</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		<p>
			Notice that all three data sets have a mean of 5 points and median of 5 points, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different from each other. In Section A, everyone had the same score; in Section B half the class earned no points and the other half got a perfect score. The scores for Section C are less consistent than the other sections but grouped closer to the central score of 5.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, in addition the measures of center, we also need a measure of how <q>spread out</q> (or <q>varied</q>, or <q>dispersed</q>) each data set is in order to characterize it well.  There are several ways to measure the variation of a distribution. In this section we will look at the <alert>range</alert>, <alert>interquartile range (IQR)</alert>, and <alert>standard deviation</alert>.
