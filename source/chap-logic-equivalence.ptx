  <introduction>
    <p>
      Two statements are <term>logically equivalent</term> if they have the same truth value in every possible situation. In other words, no matter the circumstances, both statements are either true or false simultaneously.
    This relationship is often denoted <m>P\equiv Q</m> symbolically, and means that statements <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are interchangeable in logical arguments.
