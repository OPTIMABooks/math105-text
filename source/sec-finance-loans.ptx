  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the last section, you learned about savings plans. In this section, you will learn about <term> payout annuities</term> and <term>conventional loans</term>. These two financial concepts use the same formula: the <term>present value of an annuity</term> formula.  In this section we will also briefly cover credit cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a payout annuity, the account is opened with a lump sum, and money is withdrawn from the account on a regular basis.  The money remaining in the account earns interest.  After a fixed amount of time, the account will be empty. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Conventional loans are also called <term>amortized loans</term> or <term>installment loans</term>. They are designed so that the payment amount remains the same over the life (term) of the loan.Examples include student loans, car loans and home mortgages. The techniques we use to analyze these loans do not apply to payday loans, add-on loans, or other loan types where the interest is calculated up front. 
    </p>
 
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-present-value-annuities">
    <title>Present Value of an Annuity</title>
    <p>
      The <term>present value</term> of an annuity is the amount of money we would need now in order to be able to make the payments in the annuity in the future. In other word, the present value is the value now of a future stream of payments.
      To better understand what this means, consider the following example.
    </p>

      <p>
        Suppose Carlos owns a small business and employs an assistant manager to help him run the business.  Assume it is January 1 now.  Carlos plans to pay his assistant manager a $1000 bonus at the end of this year and another $1000 bonus at the end of the following year. Carlos' business earned good profits last year so he wants to put the money for his assistant's future bonuses into a savings account now.  The money he puts in now will earn interest at the rate of 4% per year compounded annually while in the savings account. 
      </p>
      <p>
        How much money should Carlos put into the savings account now so that he will be able to withdraw $1000 one year from now and another $1000 two years from now? At first, this sounds like a sinking fund, but the situation is actually different.  In a sinking fund, we put money into the fund with periodic payments to save to accumulate to a specified lump sum that is the future value at the end of a specified time period.
        In this case we want to put a lump sum into the savings account now, so that lump sum is our principal, <m>P</m>.  Then we want to withdraw that amount as a series of period payments; here the withdrawals are an annuity with $1000 payments at the end of each of two years.
        This scenario is illustrated in <xref ref="fig-amortization-cartoon"/>.

        <caption>How much should Carlos invest now to able to withdraw two payments of $1000 at the end of the next two years and end with a zero account balance? </caption>

        </image>
      </figure>
      <p>
        To answer this question we use the compound interest formula from <xref ref="sec-finance-compound-interest"/> with <m>r = 0.04</m> and <m>n = 1</m> for annual compounding to determine the present value of each payment of $1000.
        Consider the first payment of $1000 at the end of year 1. Let <m>P_1</m> be its present value:
        <me>
           \$1000 = P_1(1.04)^1 \Rightarrow P_1 =\$961.54.
        </me>
        Now consider the second payment of $1000 at the end of year 2. Let <m>P_2</m> is its present value:
        <me>
          \$1000 = P_2(1.04)^2 \Rightarrow P_2 =\$924.56.
        </me>
        To make the $1000 payments at the specified times in the future, the amount that Carlos needs to deposit now is the present value 
        <me>
          P = P_1 + P_2 = \$961.54 + \$924.56 = \$1886.10.
        </me>
        <alert>Note:</alert> Carlos needs to save less than $2000 now because his deposit will earn interest while it is waiting to be withdrawn. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The calculation above was useful to illustrate the meaning of the present value of an annuity, but it is not an efficient way to calculate the present value.  If we were to have a large number of annuity payments, the step by step calculation would be long and tedious.  
        Instead, we use the formula shown below. This formula is derived in a similar way to the way we derived the formula for the future value of an annuity in <xref ref="subsec-derivation-future-value-of-annuity"/>. The details are omitted here.

          <p>
            After retiring, you want to be able to take $1000 every month for a total of 20 years from your retirement account.  The account earns 6% interest.  How much will you need in your account when you retire?

        <solution>
          <p>
            This is a annuity question where we seek the present value (or lump sum) needed to generate the sequence of anticipated payments. 
            In this example, <m>d = \$1000</m>, <m>r = 0.06</m>, <m>n = 12</m>, since we want monthly withdrawals, and <m>t = 20</m> because we are taking withdrawals for 20 years. <m>P</m> is unknown.

              <mrow>  \approx\amp \$139{,}580.77. </mrow>
          </md>
            That is, you will need to have $139,580.77 in your account when you retire.

      </p>
      <p>
        The present value of an annuity formula can also be used to find the annuity payment, as shown in the next example.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            You know you will have $500,000 in your retirement account when you retire.  You want to be able to take monthly withdrawals from the account for a total of 30 years.  Your retirement account earns 8% interest.  How much will you be able to withdraw each month?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            This is a annuity question where we know present value <m>P</m> but seek to find the payment (or dispersement) <m>d</m>.
            In this example, <m>P = \$500{,}000</m>, <m>r = 0.08</m>, <m>n = 12</m>, since we want monthly withdrawals, and <m>t = 30</m> because we are taking withdrawals for 20 years. The withdrawal amount <m>d</m> is unknown.

    <title>Installment Loans</title>
    <p>
      Installment loans are also called <alert>amortized loans</alert>. They are designed so that the payment amount remains the same over the life (term) of the loan. In order for that amount to remain constant, the amount of money going towards paying the <alert>principal</alert> (amount owed) and towards the <alert>interest</alert> will vary. At the beginning of the loan, the amount owed is the largest. So, at the beginning the amount of interest charged will also be the largest. As the loan gets repaid the amount owed is reduced and therefore the interest is reduced. Therefore, at the beginning of an installment loan payments go mostly towards the interest, towards the end the payments are going mostly towards the principal.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-installment-loan-interest-principal">
      <caption>This is a graph of the interest and principal paid on a loan of $34,000 at 10% APR. Each year $5,391.72 was paid in total. In the first year, $3,305.92 was applied to the interest and $2,085.80 was applied to the principal. In the last year of the loan, only $281.04 was applied to the interest and $5,110.68 was applied to the principal. Over 5 years, a total of $53,917.2 was paid for a loan of $34,000.</caption>

    <p>
      Amortized loan question are solved using the same present value of annuity formula use for payout annuities. The primary difference is one of context. The equations can be solved for <m>P</m> or <m>d</m> as before, but the interpretation of the result is different.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        You can afford $200 per month as a car payment. If you can get an auto loan at 3% APR for 60 months (5 years), how expensive of a car can you afford? In other words, what amount loan can you pay off with $200 per month?
        How much interest would you pay for this loan?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>
        In this example, we are looking for <m>P</m>, the starting amount of the loan. We are given values for <m>d=\$200</m>, the monthly loan payment, <m>r=0.03</m>, the annual interest rate, and <m>t=5</m>, since we're making monthly payments for 5 years. 
        Since we're doing monthly payments, <m>n=12</m>. Then:
        <md>
          <mrow>P \amp= d \left[\frac{1-\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{-nt}}{\frac{r}{n}} \right]</mrow>

          <mrow> \amp= 200\left[\frac{1-(1.0025)^{-60}}{0.0025}\right]</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp\approx\$11{,}130.47</mrow>
        </md>
        That is, you can afford a maximum loan of $11,130.47. If you have a down payment you can add that to get the value of the car you can buy. If there are any closing costs for the loan you also need to take that into consideration.
      </p>    
      <p>
        To find the amount of interest you will pay for this loan, calculate the total of all your payments.
        <me>\$200(5)(12)=\$12{,}000</me>
        Then take the difference between the total payments and the loan amount.
        <me>\$12{,}000-\$11{,}130.47=\$869.53</me>
        In this case, you would be paying $869.53 in interest.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Teresa wants to buy a car that costs $15,000. She has $3,000 saved for the car and plans to finance the rest. She found a 3-year loan at 2.75% APR and a 5-year loan at 4% APR. How much would her monthly car payment be for the first loan option? For the second? How does the interest Teresa would pay compare for each loan?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First note that Teresa is making a down payment, so the amount of the loan she needs is <m>\$15{,}000-\$3{,}000=\$12{,}000</m>. This is the value of <m>P</m>. We solve for the unknown payment, <m>d</m> using the present value of an annuity formula.

          <em>Loan Option 1:</em> For the first option, <m>P = 12000</m>, <m>n = 12</m>, <m>r = 0.0275</m>, and <m>t = 3</m>. Solving for <m>d</m>:

          </md>
          For the first loan option, Teresa's payment is $347.65 per month. Over the course of this loan, she would pay
          <me>
            12(3)(\$347.65) - \$12{,}000 = \$515.40
          </me>
          of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Loan Option 2:</em> For the second option, the values of <m>P</m> and <m>n</m> are the same, but <m>r = 0.08</m>, and <m>t = 5</m>. Solving again for <m>d</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>  12{,}000 =\amp d \left[\frac{1-\left(1+\frac{0.08}{12}\right)^{-12\cdot 5}}{\frac{0.08}{12}}\right]</mrow>

          </md>
          For the second loan option, Teresa's payment is $243.32 per month. Over the course of this loan, she would pay
          <me>
            12(5)(\$243.32) - \$12{,}000 = \$2{,}599.20
          </me>
          of interest. That is, for the second loan her monthly payment would be less, but because she is paying off the loan more slowly it accumulates more interest.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      So far, we have looked at car loans. Student loans and home mortgages are calculated in the same way. Here is an example of a mortgage payment.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        You want to take out a $140,000 mortgage (home loan). The interest rate on the loan is 6%, and the loan is for 30 years. How much will your monthly payments be? What percentage of your total payments will go towards interest?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>
        In this example we have: <m>r=0.06</m>, <m>n=12</m>, <m>t=30</m>, and <m>P=\$140{,}000</m>. We will use the present value of an annuity formula to solve for for <m>d</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>  140{,}000 =\amp d \left[\frac{1-\left(1+\frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{-12\cdot 30}}{\frac{0.06}{12}}\right]</mrow>
          <mrow>  140{,}000 =\amp d \left[\frac{1-1.005^{-360}}{0.005}\right]</mrow>
          <mrow>  140{,}000 =\amp d(166.791614) </mrow>
          <mrow>  d =\amp\frac{140{,}000}{166.791614} </mrow>
          <mrow>  \approx\amp\$839.37 </mrow>
        </md>
        You would make payments of $839.37 per month for 30 years. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To find out what percentage of the total will go towards interest, we need to total up all of the payments.
        <me>\$839.37(30)(12)=\$302{,}173.20</me>
        Then take the difference between the total payments and the loan amount.
        <me>\$302{,}173.20-\$140{,}000=\$162{,}173.20</me>
        In this case, you would be paying $162,173.20 in interest over the life of the loan. 
      </p>   
      <p>     
        To find the percentage, we divide the interest by the total amount paid.
        <me>\frac{\$162{,}173.20}{\$302{,}173.20} \approx 0.5367</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        About 53.7% of the total is being paid towards interest.
      </p>
    </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      With loans, it is sometimes desirable to determine what the remaining loan balance will be after some number of years. For example, if you purchase a home and plan to sell it in five years, you might want to know how much of the loan balance you will have paid off and how much you will have to pay from the sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine the remaining loan balance after some number of years, we first need to calculate the payment amount, if we don't already know it. Remember that only a portion of your loan payments go towards the loan balance; a portion is going to go towards interest. For example, if your payments were $1,000 a month, after a year you will <em>not</em> have paid off $12,000 of the loan balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine the remaining loan balance, we can think <q>how much loan will these loan payments be able to pay off in the remaining time on the loan?</q>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        If a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 6% APR has payments of $1,000 a month, what will the loan balance be in 5 years?
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To determine this, we need to think backwards. We are looking for the amount of the loan that can be paid off by $1,000 per month in the remaining 25 years. In other words, we're looking for <m>P</m> when:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><m>d=\$1{,}000</m></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> <m>r=0.06</m></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><m>n=12</m></p>

      Sometimes answering remaining balance questions requires two steps, both of which we have done in this section:
      <ol marker="1">
        <li>
          <p>
            Calculate the monthly payment on the loan
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Calculate the remaining loan balance based on the <em>remaining time</em> on the loan
          </p>
        </li>

    <title>Credit Cards</title>
      <p>
        Credit cards are useful to many people. They can be used to build a credit score, as a short-term loan and as an alternative to physical cash. It is highly advisable to fully pay off a credit card each month because the interest rates are much higher than the conventional installment loans we discussed earlier. There can also be many expensive fees applied when carrying a balance. Because of these higher rates, it can be very easy to get into a lot of debt quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Credit cards are a common source of loan money, and therefore a common source of debt which must be repaid.  There are much fewer and lower barriers to obtaining and using a credit card than there are to obtaining, for example, a mortgage.  As such, there are some drawbacks both in terms of typically higher interest rates, as well as some structural differences.
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
        <p>
          Amira gets a credit card, with 17.99% APR compounding daily. She uses the card to buy a $900 plane ticket.  She does not make any payments during the interest-free grace period. Her first payment is due 35 days after the grace period ended. Following the fine print in the credit card agreement, the minimum payment is calculated to be 1% of the outstanding balance after applying the APR; or $25, whichever is larger. What is her outstanding balance? What is her minimum payment? If she pays the minimum payment what will her new balance be?
        </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            First we will see what she owes with the 17.99% APR using the compound interest formula for 35 days:
            <me>900\left(1+\frac{0.1799}{365}\right)^{35} \approx 915.66</me>
            With interest, at the end of the month Amira owes $915.66.
          </p>
          <p>
             Now we will find one percent of the new balance which is 
             <me>\$915.66(0.01) \approx \$9.16</me>
            $25 is larger than $9.16, so her first payment must be at least $25. If she makes the minimum payment we can subtract to find her new balance:
            <me>\$915.66-\$25 = \$890.66</me>
            Her new balance will be $890.66.
          </p>
        </solution>
