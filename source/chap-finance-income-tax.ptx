    <title>A Very Brief History of Taxes</title>
      <p>
        Although Benjamin Franklin famously claimed in 1789 that “in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”, it wasn't until 1913 that the 16th amendment was ratified, and income tax was legalized. 
        Prior to this, taxes were primarily collected through tariffs on imported goods, poll taxes, and property taxes. A <term>poll tax</term>, also referred to as a head tax, was a fixed amount every liable individual had to pay. 
        Payment of the poll tax was often required before a person could register to vote or be issued a hunting or fishing license.

        Tax policy in the United States is a politically divisive issue. In general, Democrats seek to lower taxes for low and middle income earners and raise taxes for the wealthy, while Republicans support a variety of tax cuts and limiting the amount wealthy earners are taxed. 
        There is even debate as to the current length of the tax code! Some claim that the code is over 70,000 pages while others insist it is just over 2,000. Nevertheless, there is at least one thing everyone can agree with - you don't want to be on the wrong side of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

      <title>Types of Income Tax</title>
      <p>
        <term>Income tax</term> is a tax that is levied on earned income or profit. Income taxes are collected by the federal government, states, and even some municipalities. Income taxes are an important source of funding, and are used to finance social programs, maintain and expand infrastructure, and provide foreign aid, among other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>Federal Income Tax:</alert> Anyone who earns income over a certain amount (approximately $10,000 for an individual) must file a federal tax return and have taxes collected on their behalf. The amount of federal tax owed is determined by your <term>filing status</term> and <term>taxable income</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>State Income Tax:</alert> Forty-one states and the District of Columbia collect taxes on income from wages and investment. Seven states - Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, Texas, and Florida – do not collect tax on wage or investment income, and two states – New Hampshire and Tennessee – only collect tax on investment income. The amount of tax collected varies by state, with each state averaging between $500 and $3000 per person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>Municipal Income Tax:</alert> Some municipalities (urban districts) also collect income taxes. For example, business owners in Multnomah County Oregon pay a municipal tax on their business income, and workers in the Portland Oregon Tri-met district (area served by Tri-met) have their wages taxed at 0.7537%.

      <title>Calculating Federal Income Tax</title>
      <p>
        Not all income is taxed, and not all income that gets taxed is taxed at the same rate. The general process of calculating the amount of federal income tax you owe is outlined in the chart below.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <caption>Steps to Calculate Federal Income Tax</caption>
        <image width="100%" source="images/financial_math/calculating_federal.png">
        <shortdescription>Five rectangles showing the steps: 1. Calculate gross income by adding all income; 2. Calculate adjusted gross income (AGI) by subtracting any pre-tax adjustments; 3. Calculate taxable income by subtracting deductions (itemized or standard); 4. Calculate tax using tax table for your filing status; 5. Calculate refund or amount owed by subtracting credits and withholdings. If the amount is negative you get a refund; if the amount is positive you owe money.</shortdescription>
        </image>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <term>Gross income</term> includes all wages, tips, earned interest, dividends, rents and royalties, alimony, property gains, income tax refunds, etc. Keep in mind that ALL income means ALL income. Even income earned from a crime must be reported!
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Adjustments</term> are eligible expenses used to reduce your gross income. Adjustments are tax-exempt and thus reduce the amount owed in taxes. Eligible expenses include contributions to tax deferred savings plans (401k, Individual Retirement Plan (IRA)), school tuition, student loan interest, moving expenses, business expenses, flexible spending accounts and health savings account contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Taxable income</term> is determined by subtracting your <term>deductions</term> from your adjusted gross income. You may choose to take <em>either</em> a <term>standard deduction</term>, which is determined by your filing status, or you may choose to <term>itemize</term> your deductions. Itemized deductions may include state and local income taxes, property taxes, medical expenses, mortgage interest, and charitable donations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to the 2018 tax year, you could also claim <term>personal exemptions</term>. Exemptions of $4,050 for each member of the household were subtracted from the adjusted gross income along with either the standard or itemized deduction to determine taxable income. Starting in 2018, however, the standard deduction was doubled, and personal exemptions were eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at an example of how to calculate gross income and adjusted gross income (AGI).
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
          Sasha received $45,000 in wages and earned $1,300 in interest from his savings plan. He paid $1,400 in student loan interest, and put $4,000 into his Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Determine Sasha's adjusted gross income. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To calculate Sasha's adjusted gross income, we need to first determine his gross income. His gross income includes his wages and earned interest:
        </p>
        <p>
          Gross Income <m>=\$45{,}000+\$1{,}300=\$46{,}300</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          To find his adjusted gross income, we need to subtract eligible adjustments from his gross income. His eligible adjustments include the interest paid on his student loans, and his contributions to his IRA:
        </p>
        <p>
          Adjusted Gross Income <m>=\$46{,}300-\$1{,}400-\$4{,}000=\$40{,}900</m>
        </p>
      </example>

    <subsection>
      <title>Filing Status</title>
      <p>
        Your <alert>filing status</alert> is determined by your family situation. Are you married, widowed, divorced, caring for a family member? It is possible to fall into more than one category, but you may choose the one that is most beneficial for you.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <alert>Single:</alert> If you are unmarried, legally separated from your spouse, or divorced on the last day of the year.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <alert>Married Filing Jointly:</alert> If you are married and both you and your spouse agree to file a joint return. (On a joint return, you report your combined income and deduct your combined allowable expenses.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <alert>Married Filing Separately:</alert> If you are married and you want to be responsible only for your own tax, or if this status results in less tax than a joint return.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <alert>Head of Household (with qualifying person):</alert> If you are 1) unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year, 2) paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year, and 3) have a qualifying dependent living with you for more than half the year (except temporary absences, such as school).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <alert>Qualifying Widow/Widower (with dependent child):</alert> This status is available for the two years following the death of your spouse.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Your filing status determines your standard deduction and tax liability. The standard deduction for each filing status for the tax year 2024 is given in the table below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is an example where we calculate adjusted gross income and taxable income.
      </p>
        
      <example>
        <statement>
        <p>
          Maria earned wages of $32,400 from her job as a server. She also earned $8,300 in tips, and received $95 in interest from a savings account. In trying to save for retirement, Maria has put $3,500 into a 401K tax deferred savings plan. She is unmarried and lives with her six year old daughter. Determine Maria's gross income, adjusted gross income, and taxable income.
        </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
        <p>
          Maria's gross income includes her wages, tips, and earned interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gross Income <m>= \$32,400 + \$8,300 + \$95 = \$40,795</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Maria can use her 401k contribution as an adjustment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adjusted Gross Income <m>= $40,795 - $3,500 = $37,295</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Maria is unmarried and is the primary caregiver for her daughter, she can file as the head of household and take the standard deduction of $21,900.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taxable Income <m>= $37,295 - $21,900 = $15,395</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Maria's taxable income is $15,395.
        </p>
      </solution>
