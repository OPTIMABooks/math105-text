    <title>A Very Brief History of Taxes</title>
      <p>
        Although Benjamin Franklin famously claimed in 1789 that “in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”, it wasn't until 1913 that the 16th amendment was ratified, and income tax was legalized. 
        Prior to this, taxes were primarily collected through tariffs on imported goods, poll taxes, and property taxes. A <alert>poll tax</alert>, also referred to as a head tax, was a fixed amount every liable individual had to pay. 
        Payment of the poll tax was often required before a person could register to vote or be issued a hunting or fishing license.

        Tax policy in the United States is a politically divisive issue. In general, Democrats seek to lower taxes for low and middle income earners and raise taxes for the wealthy, while Republicans support a variety of tax cuts and limiting the amount wealthy earners are taxed. 
        There is even debate as to the current length of the tax code! Some claim that the code is over 70,000 pages while others insist it is just over 2,000. Nevertheless, there is at least one thing everyone can agree with - you don't want to be on the wrong side of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

      <title>Types of Income Tax</title>
      <p>
        <term>Income tax</term> is a tax that is levied on earned income or profit. Income taxes are collected by the federal government, states, and even some municipalities. Income taxes are an important source of funding, and are used to finance social programs, maintain and expand infrastructure, and provide foreign aid, among other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>Federal Income Tax:</alert> Anyone who earns income over a certain amount (approximately $10,000 for an individual) must file a federal tax return and have taxes collected on their behalf. The amount of federal tax owed is determined by your <term>filing status</term> and <term>taxable income</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>State Income Tax:</alert> Forty-one states and the District of Columbia collect taxes on income from wages and investment. Seven states - Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, Texas, and Florida – do not collect tax on wage or investment income, and two states – New Hampshire and Tennessee – only collect tax on investment income. The amount of tax collected varies by state, with each state averaging between $500 and $3000 per person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>Municipal Income Tax:</alert> Some municipalities (urban districts) also collect income taxes. For example, business owners in Multnomah County Oregon pay a municipal tax on their business income, and workers in the Portland Oregon Tri-met district (area served by Tri-met) have their wages taxed at 0.7537%.
