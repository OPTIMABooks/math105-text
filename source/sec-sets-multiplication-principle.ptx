  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous section, we explored the art of counting by examining the number of elements in finite sets. Building on that foundation, particularly the inclusion-exclusion principle, we now introduce our first result in this section: the addition rule. Following our discussion on the addition rule, we will further expand our counting techniques by introducing and applying another foundational tool, the multiplication principle.

		<title>The Addition Rule</title>

			The <term>addition rule</term> is a reformulation of the <xref text="title" ref="fact-sets-inclusion-exclusion-rule"/> for mutually elusive sets.

			<title>Addition Rule</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>addition rule</term> states that if a process can occur in one of two distinct ways, where the first way has <m>n</m> possibilities and the second way has <m>m</m> possibilities, then the entire process can occur in <m>n+m</m> ways.
