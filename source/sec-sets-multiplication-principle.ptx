  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous section, we explored the art of counting by examining the number of elements in finite sets. Building on that foundation, particularly the inclusion-exclusion principle, we now introduce our first result in this section: the addition rule. Following our discussion on the addition rule, we will further expand our counting techniques by introducing and applying another foundational tool, the multiplication principle.
