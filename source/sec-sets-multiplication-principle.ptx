	<introduction>
		<p>
			In the previous section, we explored the art of counting by examining the number of elements in finite sets. Building on that foundation, particularly the inclusion-exclusion principle, we now introduce our first result in this section: the addition rule. Following our discussion on the addition rule, we will further expand our counting techniques by introducing and applying another foundational tool, the multiplication principle.

	<subsection>
		<title>The Addition Rule</title>
		<p>
			The <term>addition rule</term> is a reformulation of the <xref text="custom" ref="fact-sets-inclusion-exclusion-rule"> Inclusion-Exclusion Rule</xref> for <xref text="custom" ref="def_mutually-exclusive"> mutually exclusive</xref> sets.
		</p>
		<principle xml:id="thm_counting-rule_addition-informal">
			<title>Addition Rule</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>addition rule</term> states that if a process can occur in one of two distinct ways, where the first way has <m>n</m> possibilities and the second way has <m>m</m> possibilities, then the entire process can occur in <m>n+m</m> ways.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</principle>
		<p>
			Note that the addition rule can be extended to include process or tasks that requires <m>k</m> steps. In that case, if there are <m>n_1</m> ways to complete the first step, <m>n_2</m> ways to complete the second and so forth, then there are 
			<me>
				n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k
			</me>
			total ways to complete the task. 
			To see this common-sense counting rule in action, consider the following example.

			<title>Using the Addition Rule</title>
			<statement>
				<p>You have won a church raffle. The winning ticket entitles you to choose either one of eight possible home-made pies, or one of six types of home-made cakes. In how many ways can you make your choice?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Since you may choose either a pie <em>or</em> a cake, and none of your choices are <em>both</em> a pie and a cake, according to the addition rule you have <m>8+6=14</m> choices.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			The addition rule is useful for counting mutually exclusive cases. For non-mutually exclusive scenarios, use <xref text="custom" ref="fact-sets-inclusion-exclusion-rule"> Inclusion-Exclusion Rule</xref>.

		<title>The Multiplication Rule</title>
		<p>
			Some processes have two or more steps, rather than cases, each of which can happen in several different ways. In order to determine the total number of ways that such a multi-step process can happen, we need to use a new rule, called the <term>multiplication rule</term>.
		</p>
		<principle xml:id="thm_counting-rule_multiplication">
			<idx>multiplication rule (counting)</idx>
			<idx><h>counting rules</h><h>multiplication</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>multiplication rule</term> states that if a tasks consists of two steps where step one can happen in <m>n_1</m> ways and step two can happen in <m>n_2</m> ways, then the entire task can be done in <m>n_1 \times n_2</m> different ways.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</principle>
		<p>
			<alert>Note:</alert> The multiplication rule can be expanded to a process which includes <m>k</m> stages, the <m>i^\text{th}</m> of which can happen in <m>n_i</m> ways, then the total number of ways the task can be done is:
			<me>
				n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k
			</me>.
		</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_counting_multiplication_2-step">
			<statement>
				<p>
					A college student has two pairs of clean pants and three clean shirts. How many outfits are possible, where an <q>outfit</q> is a pair of pants and a shirt?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Picking an outfit requires two steps:
					<ol>
						<li><p>Choosing a pair of pants from 2 choices,</p></li>
						<li><p>Choosing a shirt from 3 choices.</p></li>
					</ol>
					Thus, by the multiplication rule the total number of outfits is:
					<me>2 \times 3 = 6</me>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<example xml:id="ex_counting_multiplication_3-step">
			<statement>
				<p>
					At a lunch buffet, you can choose from 4 types of sandwiches, 5 types of drinks, and 3 types of desserts. How many different meal combinations can you create by selecting one item from each category?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p> 
					Selecting a meal requires three steps::
					<ol>
						<li><p>Choosing a sandwich from 4 options,</p></li>
						<li><p>Choosing a drink from 5 options,</p></li>
						<li><p>Choosing a dessert from 3 options.</p></li>
					</ol>
					The total number of lunch combinations is thus:
					<me>4\times 5\times 3 = 60</me>.
