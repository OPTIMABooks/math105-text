	<introduction>
		<p>
			In the previous section, we explored the art of counting by examining the number of elements in finite sets. Building on that foundation, particularly the inclusion-exclusion principle, we now introduce our first result in this section: the addition rule. Following our discussion on the addition rule, we will further expand our counting techniques by introducing and applying another foundational tool, the multiplication principle.

		<title>The Addition Rule</title>
		<p>
			The <term>addition rule</term> is a reformulation of the <xref text="custom" ref="fact-sets-inclusion-exclusion-rule"> Inclusion-Exclusion Rule</xref> for <xref text="custom" ref="def_mutually-exclusive"> mutually exclusive</xref> sets.
		</p>
		<principle xml:id="thm_counting-rule_addition-informal">
			<title>Addition Rule</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>addition rule</term> states that if a process can occur in one of two distinct ways, where the first way has <m>n</m> possibilities and the second way has <m>m</m> possibilities, then the entire process can occur in <m>n+m</m> ways.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</principle>
		<p>To see this common-sense counting rule in action, consider the following example.</p>
		<example xml:id="ex_counting_addition-informal">
			<title>Using the Addition Rule</title>
			<statement>
				<p>You have won a church raffle. The winning ticket entitles you to choose either one of eight possible home-made pies, or one of six types of home-made cakes. In how many ways can you make your choice?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Since you may choose either a pie <em>or</em> a cake, and none of your choices are <em>both</em> a pie and a cake, according to the addition rule you have <m>8+6=14</m> choices.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			The addition rule is useful for counting mutually exclusive cases. For non-mutually exclusive scenarios, use <xref text="custom" ref="fact-sets-inclusion-exclusion-rule"> Inclusion-Exclusion Rule</xref>.

		<title>The Multiplication Rule</title>
		<p>
			Some processes have two or more steps, rather than cases, each of which can happen in several different ways. In order to determine the total number of ways that such a multi-step process can happen, we need to use a new rule, called the <term>multiplication rule</term>.
		</p>
		<principle xml:id="thm_counting-rule_multiplication">
			<idx>multiplication rule (counting)</idx>
			<idx><h>counting rules</h><h>multiplication</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>multiplication rule</term> states that if a tasks consists of two steps where step one can happen in <m>n_1</m> ways and step two can happen in <m>n_2</m> ways, then the entire task can be done in <m>n_1 \times n_2</m> different ways.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</principle>
		<p>
			<alert>Note:</alert> The multiplication rule can be expanded to a process which includes <m>k</m> stages, the <m>i^\text{th}</m> of which can happen in <m>n_i</m> ways, then the total number of ways the task can be done is:
		<me>
			n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k
		</me>.
