		<title>Propositions</title>
			
		<p>  
			The basic building block of symbolic logic is the <term>proposition</term> or <term>statement</term>.
			A <term>proposition</term> is a declarative sentence that can be meaningfully classified as either true or false. Such statements are unlike everyday sentences, which can be questions, commands, or expressions with unclear meanings. 
			Propositions are used in symbolic logic because they remove any vagueness or implied meanings that might confuse the application of logical principles.
		</p>
		<example>
			<statement>
			<p>
				Which of the following are propositions?
				<ol marker="a">
					<li>
						<p>
							I am reading a math book.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Math is fun!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Do you like turtles?
						</p>
					</li>
						<li>
						<p>
							My cat
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>
				The first and second items are propositions. The third one is a question and the fourth is a phrase, so they are not. We are not concerned right now about whether a statement is true or false. We will come back to that later when we look at compound statements.
			</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			Arguments are made of one or more propositions (called <term>premises</term>), along with a <term>conclusion</term>. Propositions may be <term>negated</term>, or combined with <term>connectors</term> like <q>and</q>, and <q>or</q> to make new propositions. Let's take a closer look at how negations and logical connectors are used to create more complex statements.

		<title>Negation (not)</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				One way to change a proposition is to use its <term>negation</term>, or opposite meaning. The word <q><term>not</term></q> is often used to negate a statement.
			</p>
			<example>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Write the negation of the following propositions.
				<ol marker="a">
					<li>
						<p>
							I am reading a math book.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Math is fun!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The sky is not green.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Cars have wheels.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
					<ol marker="a">
						<li>
							<p>
								Negation: I am <insert>not</insert> reading a math book.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Negation: Math is <insert>not</insert> fun!
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Negation: The sky is green (or <insert>not</insert> not green).
							</p>
						</li>
							<li>
							<p>
								Negation: Cars do <insert>not</insert> have wheels.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

			<title>Negation of Quantifiers</title>
			<p>
				It is worth mentioning the <term>quantifiers</term> <q><term>all</term></q> and <q><term>some</term></q> and how to negate them. 
				If we were to make the statement, <q><alert>All</alert> students read this book,</q> we could negate it by saying <q><alert>Not all</alert> students read this book</q> or <q><alert>Some</alert> students <alert>don't</alert> read this book.</q> Notice how this is very different from <q><alert>No</alert> students read this book.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				If we were to negate, <q><alert>No</alert> students read this book,</q> we could say, <q><alert>A</alert> student is reading this book,</q> or even, <q><alert>Some</alert> students do read this book.</q> 
				It only takes one counterexample to negate an all or nothing statement and the phrases <alert>some do</alert> and <alert>some don't</alert> are often used for this purpose. The same concept applies to similar words like everyone, nobody, always and never.
			</p>
			<example>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Write two different negations of each statement.
					<ol marker="a">
					<li>
						<p>
							All college students take psychology.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Dogs are never brown.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
					<ol marker="a">
					<li>
						<p>
							Negations: <insert>Not</insert> all college students take psychology, or, <insert>Some</insert> college students <alert>don't</alert> take psychology.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Negations: <insert>There are</insert> brown dogs, or, <insert>Some</insert> dogs are brown.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>
				For the most part, we will deal with <em>unquantified</em> logic in this book.

			<title>Multiple Negations</title>
			<p>
				It is possible to use more than one negation in a statement. If you've ever said something like, <q>I <alert>can't not</alert> go,</q> you are saying you will go. In fact, it's often used for emphasis or a slightly different meaning, that you really must go. If someone says, <q>I <alert>don't disagree</alert>,</q> they may be saying they don't exactly agree but the person has a point. A <term>double negative</term> is similar to multiplying two negative numbers which gives a positive result. Using a third negation would then be equivalent to a single negation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that in some instances a negation word like <q>no,</q> <q>nobody,</q> or <q>nothing</q> is used to emphasize rather than negate and this is called <term>negative concord</term>. For example, <q>I ain't got no money,</q> is not a double negative but rather an emphasis of not having any money. This is common across many varieties of English and other languages. You can read more about negative concord at this <url href="https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/negative-concord" visual="ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/negative-concord">site</url>. In general, use your judgment and context cues to distinguish between a double negative and negative concord. We will use multiple negations but not negative concord in this book.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the media and in ballot measures we often see multiple negations and it can be confusing to figure out what a statement means.
			</p>
		
			<example>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Read the statement and determine the outcome of a yes vote.
				</p>
				<p>
					<q>Vote for this measure to repeal the ban on plastic bags.</q>
				</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						If you said that a yes vote would enable plastic bag usage, you are correct. The ban stopped plastic bag usage, so to repeal the ban would allow it again. This measure has a double negation and is also not very good for the environment.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			
			<example>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Read the statement and determine the outcome on mandatory minimum sentencing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<q>The bill that overturned the ban on mandatory minimum sentencing was vetoed.</q>
				</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						In this case mandatory minimum sentencing would not be allowed. The ban would stop it, and the bill to overturn it was vetoed. This is an example of a triple negation.
					</p>
