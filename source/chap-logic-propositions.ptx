		<title>Propositions</title>
			
		<p>  
			The basic building block of symbolic logic is the <term>proposition</term> or <term>statement</term>.
			A <term>proposition</term> is a declarative sentence that can be meaningfully classified as either true or false. Such statements are unlike everyday sentences, which can be questions, commands, or expressions with unclear meanings. 
			Propositions are used in symbolic logic because they remove any vagueness or implied meanings that might confuse the application of logical principles.
		</p>
		<example>
			<statement>
			<p>
				Which of the following are propositions?
				<ol marker="a">
					<li>
						<p>
							I am reading a math book.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Math is fun!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Do you like turtles?
						</p>
					</li>
						<li>
						<p>
							My cat
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>
				The first and second items are propositions. The third one is a question and the fourth is a phrase, so they are not. We are not concerned right now about whether a statement is true or false. We will come back to that later when we look at compound statements.
			</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>
			Arguments are made of one or more propositions (called <term>premises</term>), along with a <term>conclusion</term>. Propositions may be <term>negated</term>, or combined with <term>connectors</term> like <q>and</q>, and <q>or</q> to make new propositions. Let's take a closer look at how negations and logical connectors are used to create more complex statements.

		<title>Negation (not)</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				One way to change a proposition is to use its <term>negation</term>, or opposite meaning. The word <q><term>not</term></q> is often used to negate a statement.
			</p>
			<example>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Write the negation of the following propositions.
				<ol marker="a">
					<li>
						<p>
							I am reading a math book.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Math is fun!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The sky is not green.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Cars have wheels.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
					<ol marker="a">
						<li>
							<p>
								Negation: I am <insert>not</insert> reading a math book.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Negation: Math is <insert>not</insert> fun!
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Negation: The sky is green (or <insert>not</insert> not green).
							</p>
						</li>
							<li>
							<p>
								Negation: Cars do <insert>not</insert> have wheels.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

			<title>Negation of Quantifiers</title>
			<p>
				It is worth mentioning the <term>quantifiers</term> <q><term>all</term></q> and <q><term>some</term></q> and how to negate them. 
				If we were to make the statement, <q><alert>All</alert> students read this book,</q> we could negate it by saying <q><alert>Not all</alert> students read this book</q> or <q><alert>Some</alert> students <alert>don't</alert> read this book.</q> Notice how this is very different from <q><alert>No</alert> students read this book.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				If we were to negate, <q><alert>No</alert> students read this book,</q> we could say, <q><alert>A</alert> student is reading this book,</q> or even, <q><alert>Some</alert> students do read this book.</q> 
				It only takes one counterexample to negate an all or nothing statement and the phrases <alert>some do</alert> and <alert>some don't</alert> are often used for this purpose. The same concept applies to similar words like everyone, nobody, always and never.
			</p>
			<example>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Write two different negations of each statement.
					<ol marker="a">
					<li>
						<p>
							All college students take psychology.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Dogs are never brown.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
					<ol marker="a">
					<li>
						<p>
							Negations: <insert>Not</insert> all college students take psychology, or, <insert>Some</insert> college students <alert>don't</alert> take psychology.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Negations: <insert>There are</insert> brown dogs, or, <insert>Some</insert> dogs are brown.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			<p>
				For the most part, we will deal with <em>unquantified</em> logic in this book.
