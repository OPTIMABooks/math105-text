		<title>Propositions</title>
			
		<p>  
			The basic building block of symbolic logic is the <term>proposition</term> or <term>statement</term>.
			A <term>proposition</term> is a declarative sentence that can be meaningfully classified as either true or false. Such statements are unlike everyday sentences, which can be questions, commands, or expressions with unclear meanings. 
			Propositions are used in symbolic logic because they remove any vagueness or implied meanings that might confuse the application of logical principles.
