	<title>Truth Tables</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			In logic we can use a <term>truth table</term> to analyze a complex statement by summarizing all the possibilities and their <term>truth values</term> (true or false). To do this, we break the statement down to its smallest elements, the propositions. We can then see the outcome of the complex statement for all possible combinations of true and false for the propositions.
		</p>	
		<p>
			For example, suppose we have the following two propositions:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>R</em>: You paid your rent this month.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>E</em>: You paid your electric bill this month.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			We use these two propositions to demonstrate the truth tables for <em>not, and,</em> and <em>or.</em>
			Before reading on, make sure you have reviewed the logical symbols shown in the <xref text="title" ref="assemblage-logical-symbols"/> block of <xref ref="sec-logic-propositions"/>.

					To set up a truth table, we list all the possible truth value combinations in a systematic way. One way to do this is to make the first column half true, then half false, then cut the pattern in half with each succeeding column. For two propositions, the first two columns are shown to the right.

				<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
					<row header="yes">
						<cell> <m>R</m> </cell>
						<cell> <m>E</m> </cell>
						<cell> <m>R \land E </m></cell>

						<cell>T</cell>
						<cell>T</cell>

					</row>
					<row>
						<cell>F</cell>
						<cell>F</cell>
						<cell></cell>
					</row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>
	
		<p>
			The four possible combinations are
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Row 1: You have paid your rent and electric bill.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Row 2: You have paid your rent but not your electric bill.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Row 3: You have not paid your rent but you have paid your electric bill.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Row 4: You haven't paid either your rent or electric bill (yet).
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Once we fill in the starting columns, we add additional columns for the more complex statements. We can add as many columns as needed. Below are the basic truth tables for <em>not, and,</em> and <em>or.</em>

		<title>Truth Tables for the Conditional</title>
		<p>
			 To understand the truth table values for a conditional statement it is really helpful to look at it in context. We used this example in <xref ref="sec-logic-propositions"/> and we'll summarize it again here. Let's say a friend tells you, <q>If you post that photo to social media, you'll lose your job.</q> Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?
		</p>
		<p>
			 There are four possible outcomes:
			 <ol>
				 <li>
					 <p>
						 You post the photo and lose your job.
					 </p>
				 </li>
				 <li>
					 <p>
						 You post the photo and don't lose your job.
					 </p>
				 </li>
				 <li>
					 <p>
						 You don't post the photo and lose your job.
					 </p>
				 </li>
				 <li>
					 <p>
						 You don't post the photo and don't lose your job.
					 </p>
				 </li>
			 </ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			 The only case where you can say your friend was wrong is the second case, in which you post the photo but still keep your job.
		</p>
		<p>
			 Your friend didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't post the photo, so you can't say the last two statements are wrong. Even if you didn't post the photo and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn't post it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The four cases above correspond to the four rows of the truth table. For this truth table we will use <m>P</m> for <q>posting the photo,</q> and <m>L</m> for <q>losing your job.</q>
		</p>
		<sidebyside widths="60% 34%" margins="0% 0%" valign="middle">
			<p>
				<term>If, then</term>: In the <m>P\rightarrow L</m> (read <q>If <m>P</m>, then <m>L</m></q>) column, the only outcome that is false is if you post the photo and don't lose your job. Otherwise <m>P\rightarrow L</m> is true.
			</p>
				<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
				<row header="yes">
					<cell><m>P</m></cell>
					<cell><m>L</m></cell>
					<cell><m>P\rightarrow L</m></cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>T</cell>
					<cell>T</cell>
					<cell>T</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>T</cell>
					<cell>F</cell>
					<cell>F</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>F</cell>
					<cell>T</cell>
					<cell>T</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>F</cell>
					<cell>F</cell>
					<cell>T</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			If the hypothesis (the <q>if</q> part) is false, we cannot say that the statement is a lie, so the result of the third and fourth rows is true. Notice that we are using a double negation in this explanation.
