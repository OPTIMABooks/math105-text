  "body": " Simple Interest and Discounts      Solve problems involving simple interest.    Solve problems involving discounted loans.      It costs to borrow money. The \"rent\" one pays for the use of money is called the interest . The amount of money that is being borrowed or loaned is called the principal or present value .    Simple Interest  Simple interest is interest paid only on the original amount borrowed. In this scenario, the borrower pays a fixed interest rate on the principal for the entire time the money is held.  Calculating interest starts with the principal , P , or the beginning amount in your account. This is also called the present value . This could be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan. The interest rate , r , in its most simple form, is a percentage of the principal.  For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100. It is important to remember to change the interest rate , r, of 5% into a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left before performing any calculation.     The total amount you would repay is called the future value and would be $105, the original principal plus the interest.     One-time simple interest as in the above example is only common for extremely short-term or informal loans. For longer term loans or investments, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. In that case, interest would be earned regularly.  To see how this works, suppose you borrow $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest per year, and you keep the money for 3 years. How much would you need to repay at the end of the loan? The amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100 each year for three years, that is:     The future value of the loan would be $115, which is the original principal plus the interest.     These ideas are summarized in the block below.   Simple Interest Formulas  simple interest  financial formulas simple interest  If an amount is borrowed for a time at an interest rate , then the interest is     The amount owed at the end of years is given by        Glossary:     is the interest    is the principal, starting amount, or present value    is the interest rate in decimal form    is time, where the increment of time (years, months, etc.) matches the time period for the interest rate    is the end amount, principal plus interest, or future value      Bonds are an example of a simple investment with a regular interest payout. Bonds are issued by the federal, state or local governments to cover their expenses.    Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it. You buy a $1,000 bond that pays 5% simple interest annually and matures in 5 years. How much interest will you earn? What is the future value of the bond?    Each year, you would earn 5% interest so over the course of five years, you would earn:     When the bond matures, you would receive back the $1,000 you originally paid and the $250 in interest, so we could also put that into a single calculation:       Here are a couple more examples.    Ursula borrows $600 for 5 months at a simple interest rate of 15% per year. Find the interest, and the total amount she is obligated to pay.    The interest is computed by multiplying the principal with the interest rate and the time. Note that here the rate has units of years and the time has units of months so we convert 5 months into years by dividing by 12.  The total amount is thus   This total can be computed directly using       Darnel owes a total of $3060 which includes 12% interest for the three years he borrowed the money. How much did he originally borrow?    This time we are asked to find the principal given the future value. Darnel originally borrowed $2250.      Discounts and Proceeds  Lenders sometimes deduct the simple interest from the loan amount at the time that the loan is made. When this happens, we say the loan has been discounted . The interest that is deducted is called the discount , and the actual amount that is given to the borrower is called the proceeds . The amount the borrower is obligated to repay is called the maturity value .   Discount and Proceeds Formulas  discounted loans  financial formulas discounted loans  If an amount is borrowed for a time at an interest rate , then the discount is     The proceeds is given by        Glossary:     is the discount (interest)    is the proceeds, (the actual amount the borrower gets)    is the interest rate in decimal form    is time, where the increment of time (years, months, etc.) matches the time period for the interest rate    is the amount of the loan that must be repaid, or the maturity value.        Francisco borrows $1200 for 10 months at a simple interest rate of 15% per year. Determine the discount and the proceeds.    The discount is the interest on the loan that the bank deducts from the loan amount. Therefore, the bank deducts $150 from the maturity value of $1200 and gives Francisco $1050. That is, Francisco is obligated to repay the bank $1200.      If Francisco wants to receive $1200 for 10 months at a simple interest rate of 15% per year, what amount of loan should he apply for?    In this problem, we are given the proceeds and are being asked to find the maturity value . From the problem statement we see that . We must solve for . Thus   Therefore, Francisco should ask for a loan of $1371.43. The lender will discount the loan by $171.43 and Francisco will receive $1200.     "

  "body": " Compound Interest      Find the future value of a lump sum growing by compound interest.    Determine the present value of a lump sum of money.      In the last section, we examined problems involving simple interest. Simple interest is generally charged when the lending period is short (often less than a year). When the money is loaned or borrowed for a longer time period, interest is paid (or charged) not only on the principal, but also on the past interest. In this case, we say the interest is compounded .    APR Annual Percentage Rate  Interest rates are usually stated as an annual percentage rate (APR)  the total interest that will be paid in the year. Unless stated otherwise, assume the interest rate is an annual rate or APR. If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR will be divided by the number of time periods. The APR divided by the number of time periods is called the periodic interest rate .  Note: The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires that every consumer be given the true APR, which includes the interest and any fees.  For example, a 6% APR paid monthly, would be divided by 12, because you would get one twelfth of the rate per month, which is a periodic interest rate of half a percent per month.     Similarly, a 4% annual rate paid quarterly would be divided by 4 to get a periodic interest rate of 1% per quarter.       Suppose you buy a $1,000 federal bond with a 4% annual simple interest rate, paid semi-annually, with a maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn? What will be the future value of the bond?    The principal is . Since interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), the 4% will be divided into two 2% payments.   Four years compounded twice a year gives half-years. Thus     You will earn $160 in interest over the four years. The future value of the loan is therefore         Compound Interest  In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest. This reinvestment of interest is called compounding . We will develop the mathematical formula for compound interest and then show the equivalent spreadsheet function.  Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow?  The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn per month.  In the first month,     In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.  In the second month,     Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding gives us.  Calculating out a few more months in a table or a spreadsheet we have:    Month  Starting balance  Interest earned  Ending Balance    1  1000.00  2.50  1002.50    2  1002.50  2.51  1005.01    3  1005.01  2.51  1007.52    4  1007.52  2.52  1010.04    5  1010.04  2.53  1012.57    6  1012.57  2.53  1015.10    7  1015.10  2.54  1017.64    8  1017.64  2.54  1020.18    9  1020.18  2.55  1022.73    10  1022.73  2.56  1025.29    11  1025.29  2.56  1027.85    12  1027.85  2.56  1030.42    To find an equation to represent this, we will go through a few months to see the pattern:  Initial Amount:               Observing a pattern, we could conclude     Notice that the $1000 in the equation represents P, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the periodic interest rate, which is the annual rate divided by 12, since we were compounding monthly. Generalizing our result, we could write   Compound Interest  compound interest  financial formulas compound interest  The amount after years due to a principal invested at an annual interest rate compounded times per year is given by     Glossary:     is the future value or total amount in the account after years    is the principal or present value    is the annual interest rate in decimal form    is the number of compounding periods in one year    is the number of years      If the compounding is done annually (once a year), .  If the compounding is done quarterly, .  If the compounding is done monthly, .  If the compounding is done weekly, .  If the compounding is done daily, .  The most important thing to remember about using this formula is that it assumes that we put money in the account once and let it sit there earning interest.    If $3500 is invested at 9% compounded monthly, what will the future value be in four years?    In this example we are given values of , , , and . We use these values to compute the future value :     Thus, $3500 invested at 9% compounded monthly will accumulate to $5009.92 in four years.      How much should be invested in an account paying 9% compounded daily for it to accumulate to $5,000 in five years?    In this example we know the future value, but need to find the principal. That is, , , , and , but is unknown.   Dividing to solve for yields   Thus, $3,188.32 invested in an account paying 9% compounded daily will accumulate to $5,000 in five years.   Note: Be very careful with rounding on problems like this. Truncating or rounding decimals can lead to large changes in the final answer. The safest course is to leave the number entirely in the calculator and not round until the final step.      If $4,000 is invested at 4% compounded annually, how long will it take to accumulate to $6,000?    Note that here, are values are known except . That is, , , , and .   To solve for in the exponent we must take the of both sides:   It takes 10.33 years for $4000 to accumulate to $6000 if invested at 4% interest compounded annually.      Comparing Simple and Compound Interest  Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding in the previous example against the amount you would earn from simple interest. From the table and graph below we can see that over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and exponential growth.      Year  Simple Interest ($15 per month)  Compound Interest (6% compounded monthly or 0.5% each month    0  $3,000  $3,000    5  $3,900  $4,046.55    10  $4,800  $5,458.19    15  $5,700  $7,362.28    20  $6,600  $9,930.61    25  $7,500  $13,394.91    30  $8,400  $18,067.73    35  $9,300  $24,370.65     A coordinate graph with years on the x-axis and account balance on the y-axis. The simple interest increases in a straight line; the compound interest curves up faster because it is an exponential function.      Finding the Amount of Interest Earned and the Percentage  In suppose we also want to know how much interest was earned and what percentage of the final balance is from interest. The future value of the investment is $5,009.92. To figure out how much of that was interest, we need to subtract the amount initially deposited.   Key Idea: Total interest is always the difference between the account balance and the amount deposited (or paid).   To find the total amount of interest earned, we subtract the principal from the total balance.     The depositor earned $1,509.92 in interest.  To find the percentage of the total that is interest, divide the amount of interest by the total amount of the future value.   . That is, after 4 years 30.1% of the account balance is due to interest.     Effective Rate  If you are shopping around for different investments, you might need to compare different rates that have different compounding periods. If the rate and period are different, it is hard to know which account will give the better result. Banks are required to state their interest rate in terms of an \"effective yield\" or \"effective interest rate\", for comparison purposes. The effective rate is also called the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) .  The effective rate is the interest rate compounded annually that would be equivalent to the stated rate and compounding periods.To examine several investments to see which has the best rate, we find and compare the effective rate for each investment. The next example shows how to calculate the effective rate. effective rate    If Bank A pays 7.2% interest compounded monthly, what is the effective interest rate? If Bank B pays 7.25% interest compounded semiannually, what is the effective interest rate? Which bank pays more interest?   Bank A: Suppose we deposit $1 in this bank and leave it for a year, we will get In an account at Bank A, the interest earned is on an investment of $1. The effective interest rate (or APY) is 7.44% for this account.   Bank B: The effective rate is calculated as The effective interest rate for this account is 7.38%.  Bank A pays a slightly higher interest rate, with an effective rate of 7.44%, compared to Bank B's 7.38% effective rate.

  "body": " Annuities and Sinking Funds      Find the future value of an annuity.    Determine the payment needed to create a sinking fund with a specified value.      For most of us it is not practical to deposit a large sum of money in the bank. Instead, we save by depositing smaller amounts of money regularly. We might save in an IRA or 401-K for retirement. We might also save for a down payment on a car or house, or in a college savings plan for our children, or make regular payments into an insurance account.  A sequence of equal periodic payments is called an annuity . The payments (or deposits) can be made annually, quarterly, monthly, or at any other fixed interval of time. When the payments are made at the same time the interest is credited to the account, the annuity is called a simple annuity. When these payments are at the end of the payment period, the annuity is called ordinary . There are many types of annuities, which we will ignore here. This text will only discuss simple, ordinary annuities with equal sized payments.   Tip: If the compounding frequency is not explicitly stated in a problem, assume that the number of compounding periods per year is the same as the number of deposits per year.    Future Value of an Annuity  The mathematical formula needed to solve problems involving the future value of simple, ordinary annuities is shown below. If you want to know where the formula comes from, it is derived at the end of the chapter.   Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity  future value of an annuity  financial formulas future value of an annuity  annuities future value  If a regular payment of dollars is made in an account times a year at annual interest rate , then the future value of the annuity after years is   Glossary:     is the balance or amount in the account after years (the future value)    is the regular deposit (or payment amount each month, quarter, year, etc.)    is the annual interest rate in decimal form    is the number of compounding periods in one year    is the number of years        A traditional individual retirement account (IRA) is a special type of retirement account in which the money you invest is exempt from income taxes until you withdraw it. If you deposit $100 each month into an IRA earning 6% APR, how much will you have in the account after 20 years?    In this example the monthly deposit is , and since interest is compounded monthly . The annual interest rate is and since we want the amount after 20 years . The unknown value is , which is the value we need to compute. Putting these values into the annuity equation we have:     For monetary values, we round to the nearest cent. The account will grow to $46,204.09 after 20 years.    Depositing $100 a month for 20 years takes a lot of discipline! Was it worth it? How much interest did this annuity earn over 20 years?   Key Idea: Total interest is always the difference between the account balance and the amount deposited (or paid).    If you deposit $100 each month into an IRA earning 6% APR for 20 years, how much will you have earned in interest? What percentage of the balance is interest? Use the result of to find these values.    To find the amount of interest earned , calculate the total of all the deposits.     The difference between the total amount and the total of the deposits is the interest earned.     The total amount of interest earned was $22,204.09.  To find the percentage of the balance that is interest , divide the interest by the total balance.     or 48.1%. After 20 years 48.1% of the balance is from interest.     A note on rounding  If you are using the formulas and round during intermediate steps you will probably have some roundoff error. For this reason, enter the whole expression into the calculator. Alternately, enter the parts of the equation separately but use the calculators stored values for subsequent computations. Do not write down rounded intermediate steps and then key them back into the calculator. In the examples in this section we show intermediate value to guide you but use the unrounded value stored in the calculator to find the final answer shown.   Occasionally the problem is more complicated. For example, consider a scenario where a large, initial deposit is made with subsequent smaller, monthly deposits.    You want to jumpstart your saving by depositing $1500 from your tax return and then deposit $150 every month into an account that earns 5.5% APR compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 30 years?    This problem is solved by applying the compound interest formula to the initial deposit, and the future value of an annuity formula to the sequence of monthly payments and adding the result together. That is, where is the future value of the lump sum and the future value of the payments. For both computations , , and .  Computing first using :   Next, using compute :   Adding and rounding to the penny, in 30 years our account will contain       Computing Payments and Sinking Funds  If a specific lump sum is needed in the future, the annuity formula can be used to determine the necessary deposit size to accumulate the required amount. When a business regularly deposits money into an account to save for future equipment purchases, this savings fund is called a sinking fund . To solve these problems, the annuity formula is used to solve for , the deposit amount. sinking fund  annuities sinking fund     Danielle needs $5,000 in three years. How much should she deposit each month in an account that pays 8% compounded monthly to achieve her goal?    In this problem we know all the needed values to use the annuity formula except : , , , and . Thus,   Danielle needs to deposit $123.35 at the end of each month for 3 years into an account paying 8% compounded monthly to have $5,000 at the end of the 3 years.      A business needs $450,000 in five years to upgrade some equipment. How much should be deposited each quarter in a sinking fund that earns 9% compounded quarterly to have this amount in five years?    In this problem, we seek a value such that   Solving,   The business needs to deposit $18,063.93 at the end of each quarter for 5 years into a sinking fund earning interest of 9% compounded quarterly in order to have the $450,000 needed for the equipment upgrade at the end of 5 years.      How much interest did the business in earn on their sinking fund? What percentage of the final account balance is interest?    To find the amount of interest earned, calculate the total of all your deposits.     The difference between the total amount and the deposits is the interest earned.     The total amount of interest earned by the sinking fund was $88,721.40.  To find the percentage of the balance that is interest, we divide the interest by the total balance.     or 19.7%. After 5 years, 19.7% of the balance is from interest.      Deriving the Future Value of an Annuity Formula (Optional)  If you are interested in where the future value of an annuity formula came from, we explain it here. A savings plan with regular payments can be described recursively. Recall that basic compound interest follows from the relationship for each compound period:   For a savings plan, we need to add a deposit, d, to the account with each compounding period:   Taking this equation from recursive form to explicit form is a bit trickier than with compound interest. It will be easiest to see by working with an example rather than working in general.  Suppose we will deposit $100 each month into an account paying 6% APR. The compounding frequency is not given, but as stated in the tip at the beginning of the section, since deposits are made monthly we assume that the compounding period is monthly too.  In this example:                Writing out the recursive equation, where we use to represent the balance after compounding periods yields   Assuming we start with an empty account, we can begin using this relationship:   Continuing this pattern, after m deposits, we'd have saved:   In other words, after months, the first deposit will have earned compound interest for months. The second deposit will have earned interest for months. Last month's deposit would have earned only one month worth of interest. The most recent deposit will have earned no interest yet.  This equation leaves a lot to be desired, though – it doesn't make calculating the ending balance any easier! To simplify things, multiply both sides of the equation by 1.005:   Distributing on the right side of the equation gives   Now we'll line this up with like terms from our original equation and subtract:      Almost all the terms cancel on the right side when we subtract, leaving   Solving for :   Replacing with (Future Value), months with , where is measured in years, gives   Recall was and 100 was the deposit . The value 12 is , the number of deposits per year. Generalizing this result, we get the savings plan formula solved for . The second formula uses algebra to rearrange the formula to be solved for .

  "body": " Annuities and Amortized Loans      Find the present value of an annuity.    Solve problems involving amortization.      In the last section, you learned about savings plans. In this section, you will learn about payout annuities and conventional loans . These two financial concepts use the same formula: the present value of an annuity formula. In this section we will also briefly cover credit cards.  In a payout annuity, the account is opened with a lump sum, and money is withdrawn from the account on a regular basis. The money remaining in the account earns interest. After a fixed amount of time, the account will be empty.  Conventional loans are also called amortized loans or installment loans . They are designed so that the payment amount remains the same over the life (term) of the loan.Examples include student loans, car loans and home mortgages. The techniques we use to analyze these loans do not apply to payday loans, add-on loans, or other loan types where the interest is calculated up front.    Present Value of an Annuity  The present value of an annuity is the amount of money we would need now in order to be able to make the payments in the annuity in the future. In other word, the present value is the value now of a future stream of payments. To better understand what this means, consider the following example. present value of an annuity  annuities present value   Suppose Carlos owns a small business and employs an assistant manager to help him run the business. Assume it is January 1 now. Carlos plans to pay his assistant manager a $1000 bonus at the end of this year and another $1000 bonus at the end of the following year. Carlos' business earned good profits last year so he wants to put the money for his assistant's future bonuses into a savings account now. The money he puts in now will earn interest at the rate of 4% per year compounded annually while in the savings account.  How much money should Carlos put into the savings account now so that he will be able to withdraw $1000 one year from now and another $1000 two years from now? At first, this sounds like a sinking fund, but the situation is actually different. In a sinking fund, we put money into the fund with periodic payments to save to accumulate to a specified lump sum that is the future value at the end of a specified time period. In this case we want to put a lump sum into the savings account now, so that lump sum is our principal, . Then we want to withdraw that amount as a series of period payments; here the withdrawals are an annuity with $1000 payments at the end of each of two years. This scenario is illustrated in .       How much should Carlos invest now to able to withdraw two payments of $1000 at the end of the next two years and end with a zero account balance?   An illustration of present value for 2 payments of $1000.    To answer this question we use the compound interest formula from with and for annual compounding to determine the present value of each payment of $1000. Consider the first payment of $1000 at the end of year 1. Let be its present value: Now consider the second payment of $1000 at the end of year 2. Let is its present value: To make the $1000 payments at the specified times in the future, the amount that Carlos needs to deposit now is the present value  Note: Carlos needs to save less than $2000 now because his deposit will earn interest while it is waiting to be withdrawn.  The calculation above was useful to illustrate the meaning of the present value of an annuity, but it is not an efficient way to calculate the present value. If we were to have a large number of annuity payments, the step by step calculation would be long and tedious. Instead, we use the formula shown below. This formula is derived in a similar way to the way we derived the formula for the future value of an annuity in . The details are omitted here.   Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity  present value of an annuity  financial formulas present value of an annuity  annuities present value formula  If a payment of dollars is made in an account times a year at annual interest rate , then the present value of the annuity after years is   Glossary:     is value of the annuity at the beginning (or the principal, or amount of the loan).    is the annuity payment (or disbursement). In a loan this is the monthly payment, annual payment, etc.    is the annual interest rate in decimal form    is the number of compounding periods in one year    is the number of years        After retiring, you want to be able to take $1000 every month for a total of 20 years from your retirement account. The account earns 6% interest. How much will you need in your account when you retire?    This is a annuity question where we seek the present value (or lump sum) needed to generate the sequence of anticipated payments. In this example, , , , since we want monthly withdrawals, and because we are taking withdrawals for 20 years. is unknown. That is, you will need to have $139,580.77 in your account when you retire.     Note: In annuity problems the compounding frequency is not always explicitly given, but is determined by how often you take the withdrawals.  The present value of an annuity formula can also be used to find the annuity payment, as shown in the next example.    You know you will have $500,000 in your retirement account when you retire. You want to be able to take monthly withdrawals from the account for a total of 30 years. Your retirement account earns 8% interest. How much will you be able to withdraw each month?    This is a annuity question where we know present value but seek to find the payment (or dispersement) . In this example, , , , since we want monthly withdrawals, and because we are taking withdrawals for 20 years. The withdrawal amount is unknown. You will need to withdraw $3,668.82 per month for 30 years.      Installment Loans  Installment loans are also called amortized loans . They are designed so that the payment amount remains the same over the life (term) of the loan. In order for that amount to remain constant, the amount of money going towards paying the principal (amount owed) and towards the interest will vary. At the beginning of the loan, the amount owed is the largest. So, at the beginning the amount of interest charged will also be the largest. As the loan gets repaid the amount owed is reduced and therefore the interest is reduced. Therefore, at the beginning of an installment loan payments go mostly towards the interest, towards the end the payments are going mostly towards the principal.   This is a graph of the interest and principal paid on a loan of $34,000 at 10% APR. Each year $5,391.72 was paid in total. In the first year, $3,305.92 was applied to the interest and $2,085.80 was applied to the principal. In the last year of the loan, only $281.04 was applied to the interest and $5,110.68 was applied to the principal. Over 5 years, a total of $53,917.2 was paid for a loan of $34,000.   A graph that shows how most of the payment goes to interest at the beginning of the loan and that decreases over time until the end of the loan when most of the payment goes toward the principal.    Amortized loan questions are solved using the same present value of annuity formula use for payout annuities. The primary difference is one of context. The equations can be solved for or as before, but the interpretation of the result is different.    You can afford $200 per month as a car payment. If you can get an auto loan at 3% APR for 60 months (5 years), how expensive of a car can you afford? In other words, what amount loan can you pay off with $200 per month? How much interest would you pay for this loan?    In this example, we are looking for , the starting amount of the loan. We are given values for , the monthly loan payment, , the annual interest rate, and , since we're making monthly payments for 5 years. Since we're doing monthly payments, . Then: That is, you can afford a maximum loan of $11,130.47. If you have a down payment you can add that to get the value of the car you can buy. If there are any closing costs for the loan you also need to take that into consideration.  To find the amount of interest you will pay for this loan, calculate the total of all your payments. Then take the difference between the total payments and the loan amount. In this case, you would be paying $869.53 in interest.      Teresa wants to buy a car that costs $15,000. She has $3,000 saved for the car and plans to finance the rest. She found a 3-year loan at 2.75% APR and a 5-year loan at 4% APR. How much would her monthly car payment be for the first loan option? For the second? How does the interest Teresa would pay compare for each loan?    First note that Teresa is making a down payment, so the amount of the loan she needs is . This is the value of . We solve for the unknown payment, using the present value of an annuity formula.   Loan Option 1: For the first option, , , , and . Solving for : For the first loan option, Teresa's payment is $347.65 per month. Over the course of this loan, she would pay of interest.   Loan Option 2: For the second option, the values of and are the same, but , and . Solving again for : For the second loan option, Teresa's payment is $243.32 per month. Over the course of this loan, she would pay of interest. That is, for the second loan her monthly payment would be less, but because she is paying off the loan more slowly it accumulates more interest.    So far, we have looked at car loans. Student loans and home mortgages are calculated in the same way. Here is an example of a mortgage payment.    You want to take out a $140,000 mortgage (home loan). The interest rate on the loan is 6%, and the loan is for 30 years. How much will your monthly payments be? What percentage of your total payments will go towards interest?    In this example we have: , , , and . We will use the present value of an annuity formula to solve for for . You would make payments of $839.37 per month for 30 years.  To find out what percentage of the total will go towards interest, we need to total up all of the payments. Then take the difference between the total payments and the loan amount. In this case, you would be paying $162,173.20 in interest over the life of the loan.  To find the percentage, we divide the interest by the total amount paid.   About 53.7% of the total is being paid towards interest.    With loans, it is sometimes desirable to determine what the remaining loan balance will be after some number of years. For example, if you purchase a home and plan to sell it in five years, you might want to know how much of the loan balance you will have paid off and how much you will have to pay from the sale.  To determine the remaining loan balance after some number of years, we first need to calculate the payment amount, if we don't already know it. Remember that only a portion of your loan payments go towards the loan balance; a portion is going to go towards interest. For example, if your payments were $1,000 a month, after a year you will not have paid off $12,000 of the loan balance.  To determine the remaining loan balance, we can think how much loan will these loan payments be able to pay off in the remaining time on the loan?     If a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 6% APR has payments of $1,000 a month, what will the loan balance be in 5 years?    To determine this, we need to think backwards. We are looking for the amount of the loan that can be paid off by $1,000 per month in the remaining 25 years. In other words, we're looking for when:             , since we'd be making monthly payments for 25 more years.   Solving for : The loan balance with 25 years remaining on the loan will be $155,206.86    Sometimes answering remaining balance questions requires two steps, both of which we have done in this section:   Calculate the monthly payment on the loan    Calculate the remaining loan balance based on the remaining time on the loan       Credit Cards  Credit cards are useful to many people. They can be used to build a credit score, as a short-term loan and as an alternative to physical cash. It is highly advisable to fully pay off a credit card each month because the interest rates are much higher than the conventional installment loans we discussed earlier. There can also be many expensive fees applied when carrying a balance. Because of these higher rates, it can be very easy to get into a lot of debt quickly.  Credit cards are a common source of loan money, and therefore a common source of debt which must be repaid. There are much fewer and lower barriers to obtaining and using a credit card than there are to obtaining, for example, a mortgage. As such, there are some drawbacks both in terms of typically higher interest rates, as well as some structural differences.    Amira gets a credit card, with 17.99% APR compounding daily. She uses the card to buy a $900 plane ticket. She does not make any payments during the interest-free grace period. Her first payment is due 35 days after the grace period ended. Following the fine print in the credit card agreement, the minimum payment is calculated to be 1% of the outstanding balance after applying the APR; or $25, whichever is larger. What is her outstanding balance? What is her minimum payment? If she pays the minimum payment what will her new balance be?    First we will see what she owes with the 17.99% APR using the compound interest formula for 35 days: With interest, at the end of the month Amira owes $915.66.  Now we will find one percent of the new balance which is $25 is larger than $9.16, so her first payment must be at least $25. If she makes the minimum payment we can subtract to find her new balance: Her new balance will be $890.66.     "

Prior to this, taxes were primarily collected through tariffs on imported goods, poll taxes, and property taxes. A poll tax , also referred to as a head tax, was a fixed amount every liable individual had to pay. Payment of the poll tax was often required before a person could register to vote or be issued a hunting or fishing license.  Tax policy in the United States is a politically divisive issue. In general, Democrats seek to lower taxes for low and middle income earners and raise taxes for the wealthy, while Republicans support a variety of tax cuts and limiting the amount wealthy earners are taxed. There is even debate as to the current length of the tax code! Some claim that the code is over 70,000 pages while others insist it is just over 2,000. Nevertheless, there is at least one thing everyone can agree with - you don't want to be on the wrong side of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).    Types of Income Tax   Income tax is a tax that is levied on earned income or profit. Income taxes are collected by the federal government, states, and even some municipalities. Income taxes are an important source of funding, and are used to finance social programs, maintain and expand infrastructure, and provide foreign aid, among other things.   Federal Income Tax: Anyone who earns income over a certain amount (approximately $10,000 for an individual) must file a federal tax return and have taxes collected on their behalf. The amount of federal tax owed is determined by your filing status and taxable income .   State Income Tax: Forty-one states and the District of Columbia collect taxes on income from wages and investment. Seven states - Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, Texas, and Florida – do not collect tax on wage or investment income, and two states – New Hampshire and Tennessee – only collect tax on investment income. The amount of tax collected varies by state, with each state averaging between $500 and $3000 per person.   Municipal Income Tax: Some municipalities (urban districts) also collect income taxes. For example, business owners in Multnomah County Oregon pay a municipal tax on their business income, and workers in the Portland Oregon Tri-met district (area served by Tri-met) have their wages taxed at 0.7537%.    Calculating Federal Income Tax  Not all income is taxed, and not all income that gets taxed is taxed at the same rate. The general process of calculating the amount of federal income tax you owe is outlined in the chart below.   Steps to Calculate Federal Income Tax   Five rectangles showing the steps: 1. Calculate gross income by adding all income; 2. Calculate adjusted gross income (AGI) by subtracting any pre-tax adjustments; 3. Calculate taxable income by subtracting deductions (itemized or standard); 4. Calculate tax using tax table for your filing status; 5. Calculate refund or amount owed by subtracting credits and withholdings. If the amount is negative you get a refund; if the amount is positive you owe money.     Gross income includes all wages, tips, earned interest, dividends, rents and royalties, alimony, property gains, income tax refunds, etc. Keep in mind that ALL income means ALL income. Even income earned from a crime must be reported!   Adjustments are eligible expenses used to reduce your gross income. Adjustments are tax-exempt and thus reduce the amount owed in taxes. Eligible expenses include contributions to tax deferred savings plans (401k, Individual Retirement Plan (IRA)), school tuition, student loan interest, moving expenses, business expenses, flexible spending accounts and health savings account contributions.   Taxable income is determined by subtracting your deductions from your adjusted gross income. You may choose to take either a standard deduction , which is determined by your filing status, or you may choose to itemize your deductions. Itemized deductions may include state and local income taxes, property taxes, medical expenses, mortgage interest, and charitable donations.  Prior to the 2018 tax year, you could also claim personal exemptions . Exemptions of $4,050 for each member of the household were subtracted from the adjusted gross income along with either the standard or itemized deduction to determine taxable income. Starting in 2018, however, the standard deduction was doubled, and personal exemptions were eliminated.  Let's look at an example of how to calculate gross income and adjusted gross income (AGI).   Sasha received $45,000 in wages and earned $1,300 in interest from his savings plan. He paid $1,400 in student loan interest, and put $4,000 into his Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Determine Sasha's adjusted gross income.  To calculate Sasha's adjusted gross income, we need to first determine his gross income. His gross income includes his wages and earned interest:  Gross Income   To find his adjusted gross income, we need to subtract eligible adjustments from his gross income. His eligible adjustments include the interest paid on his student loans, and his contributions to his IRA:  Adjusted Gross Income      Filing Status  Your filing status is determined by your family situation. Are you married, widowed, divorced, caring for a family member? It is possible to fall into more than one category, but you may choose the one that is most beneficial for you.    Single: If you are unmarried, legally separated from your spouse, or divorced on the last day of the year.     Married Filing Jointly: If you are married and both you and your spouse agree to file a joint return. (On a joint return, you report your combined income and deduct your combined allowable expenses.)     Married Filing Separately: If you are married and you want to be responsible only for your own tax, or if this status results in less tax than a joint return.     Head of Household (with qualifying person): If you are 1) unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year, 2) paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year, and 3) have a qualifying dependent living with you for more than half the year (except temporary absences, such as school).     Qualifying Widow\/Widower (with dependent child): This status is available for the two years following the death of your spouse.     Your filing status determines your standard deduction and tax liability. The standard deduction for each filing status for the tax year 2024 is given in the table below.    Filing Status  Standard Deduction for Tax Year 2024    Single  $14600    Married Filing Jointly  $29200    Married Filing Separately  $14600    Head of Household  $21900    Qualifying Widow  $29200    Here is an example where we calculate adjusted gross income and taxable income.    Maria earned wages of $32,400 from her job as a server. She also earned $8,300 in tips, and received $95 in interest from a savings account. In trying to save for retirement, Maria has put $3,500 into a 401K tax deferred savings plan. She is unmarried and lives with her six year old daughter. Determine Maria's gross income, adjusted gross income, and taxable income.    Maria's gross income includes her wages, tips, and earned interest.  Gross Income   Maria can use her 401k contribution as an adjustment.  Adjusted Gross Income   Since Maria is unmarried and is the primary caregiver for her daughter, she can file as the head of household and take the standard deduction of $21,900.  Taxable Income   Maria's taxable income is $15,395.      Tax Tables  The United States has a progressive federal income tax system which means the more income you have, the more you generally pay in taxes. There are marginal tax rates that go up according to our income, but we don't pay the same rate on all of our income. The ranges of income are called tax brackets and the buckets in the illustration below can help us visualize the brackets.  The cutoff values in the figure are for a married couple filing jointly, but the percentages are the same for everyone as you'll see in the table on the next page. We pay 10% of any taxable income in the first bucket. If the first bucket is full, we move to the second bucket and we pay 12% of that income. This couple is in the 22% tax bracket because the 3rd bucket is partially filled. They will pay 22% of the income in that bucket, but they are not paying 22% of their entire income.   Tax Buckets by John Chesbrough, licensed under CC-BY-ND-NC 4.0 .   A drawing that shows the tax brackets as buckets being filled from a hose labeled taxable income; the first bucket for the 10% tax bracket is full and has the range of $0-19,050; the second bucket for the 12% tax bracket is also full and has the range of $19051-77,400; the third bucket for the 22% bracket is partially full and has the range of $77,401-165,000; there are buckets for the 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% tax brackets which are empty. The cutoff values for all of these brackets are given in the next table.    Here is a table with cutoff values for each filing status. Everyone pays a tax of 10% on any income in the first tax bracket. Then we all pay 12% of the next bracket of income, 22% of the next bracket, and so on. This keeps going up to the 37% tax bracket.   2024 Tax Year Marginal Tax Rates    Marginal Tax Rate On Taxable Income  Filing Single  Filing as Head of Household  Married filing Jointly  Married filing Separately    10%  First $11,600  First $16,550  First $23,200  First $11,600    12%  $11,600 – $47,150  $16,550 – $63,100  $23,200 – $94,300  $11,600 – $47,150    22%  $47,150 – $100,525  $63,100 – $100,500  $94,300 – $201,050  $47,150 – $100,525    24%  $100,525 – $191,950  $100,500 – $191,950  $201,050 – $383,900  $100,525 – $191,950    32%  $191,950 – $243,725  $191,950 – $243,700  $383,900 – $487,450  $191,950 – $243,725    35%  $243,725 – $609,350  $243,700 – $609,350  $487,450 – $731,200  $243,725 – $365,600    37%  Over $609,350  Over $609,350  Over $731,200  Over $365,600     Let's see how to use this table to calculate taxes in an example.    If Avery is filing single and has $55,100 in taxable income, calculate her tax.    We begin with the lowest tax bracket and take 10% of $11,600. Since Avery's income is higher than that, we add 12% of the next amount, found by subtracting the values in that bracket. Avery's taxable income is in the 22% tax bracket, so we find the amount over $47,150 by subtracting. Here is the full calculation:      Avery would owe $7,175 in taxes. Note that her overall tax rate is somewhere between 10% and 22%. We can calculate the actual rate by dividing their tax owed by her taxable income: or about 13%.    We could calculate all taxes this way, but you might notice that the first few terms will be the same if the buckets are full. For this reason, we can simplify these tax tables. The tax tables below give the value for all of the lower tax buckets that are full. There is a tax table for each filing status and the cutoffs are regularly adjusted for inflation, so they usually vary from year to year.  The next four tables give the tax calculations for 2024 federal income taxes by filing status.

Calculate her taxes using the individual tax brackets and with the simplified table.    We will calculate Adira's taxes first the long way:      Now, using the simplified tax table for single filing status, we see that Adira's taxable income puts her in the 24% tax bracket. The simplified table tells us that her taxes will be equal to $15,469 plus 24% of the excess over $100,500. Notice the number $15,469 is the total for the first three tax brackets that are “full,” so we only need to calculate the last one. To find the excess over $100,500, we subtract $100,500 from her taxable income. Thus, her taxes are:     We see that both methods result in the same value, $16,897, for Adira's taxes.      Taylor and Casey are married and filing jointly. Together their taxable income is $132,000. Use the simplified 2024 tax tables from this section to determine how much they owe in taxes.    Since Taylor and Casey are married and filing jointly, their taxable income puts them in the 22% tax bracket. Using the simplified 2024 tax table, their taxes are $10,852 plus 22% of the excess over $94,300:     Taylor and Casey owe $19,146 in taxes.      Tax Credits   Tax credits are different from deductions in that they reduce the amount of tax you owe by the full amount of the credit, not just a percentage. This makes credits much more valuable than deductions.  Common tax credits include child tax credits, earned income credits, child and dependent care credits, American opportunity tax credits, lifetime learning credits, and various federal energy credits.    Shiro is in the 22% tax bracket and itemizes his deductions. How much will his tax bill be reduced if he makes a $1,000 contribution to charity? How much will his bill be reduced if he gets a $1,000 tax credit?    The tax credit will reduce his tax bill by the full amount of the credit, so the $1,000 tax credit will reduce his tax bill by $1,000. As a deduction, however, his contribution to charity will only reduce his tax bill by 22% of the $1,000, or 0.22($1,000) = $220. Tax credits are always better than deductions.      Calculating a Refund or Payment Due  Employers are required to take out an estimated amount for taxes from each of our paychecks. These withholdings are taken out, so we don't all have huge tax bills at the end of the year, and so the government has the income it needs to run. When you file your taxes, you compare the amount of tax you actually owe, with the withholdings from your paycheck. If you had more withheld during the year than you owe, you will file for a refund. If your withholdings were less, though, you must pay the difference. Let's look at a couple of examples with tax credits and withholdings.    John's taxes are $4,342.50. He can claim an American opportunity tax credit of $2,300 and he had $3,135 withheld from his paychecks. Determine if John will owe money or get a refund.    The first step is to reduce John's taxes by the full amount of the tax credit. Next, we subtract the amount withheld from his paychecks by his employer. Since his withholdings are greater than the amount he owes after applying the tax credit, he will receive a refund equal to the difference.   John will receive a refund of $1,092.50. Notice that having a negative amount after subtracting credits and withholdings means you will receive a refund, while having a positive amount means you still owe money.      As we discovered in , Taylor and Casey owe $19,146 in taxes. Their employers withheld $9,905 and they received a $8,500 credit for their purchase of an electric car. Will they receive a refund, or will they need to make a payment?    To determine whether they will receive a refund or if they will still owe money, we will first subtract the full amount of the electric car credit. We now subtract their withholdings: Since the value is positive, Taylor and Casey still owe $741 in taxes.      Exercises    Which decreases your tax bill more, a credit or a deduction?    A credit decreases your bill more. It decreases your bill by the full amount of the credit. A deduction only decreases your tax bill by a percentage.      You are in the 12% tax bracket and get a credit of $500. How has the amount of taxes owed changed?    The amount of taxes owed is decreased by $500.      You are in the 12% tax bracket and get a deduction of $500. How has the amount of taxes owed changed?    The amount of taxes owed is decreased by $60 because 12% of $500 is $60.      Can you take the standard deduction and itemize your deductions?    No, you must choose to take either the standard deduction or itemized deductions.      Can you make adjustments to your income and take the standard deduction?    Yes, you can make adjustments and take a deduction. Adjustments to your income happen before deductions.      If you decide to take the standard deduction what have you considered?    If you decide to take the standard deduction you determine that itemizing would not save you more money.      Shaysiah has paid $13,500 in mortgage interest which she can take as a deduction and has $1,900 in other deductions that she can take this year. She is filing as single. Should she itemize her deductions or take the standard deduction?    Shaysiah should itemize because itemizing reduces her taxable income by $15,400. The standard deduction would have reduced her taxable income by $14,600.      If you are married do you have to file your taxes together?    You can either file as married filing jointly or married filing separately.      Fredrick is concerned about the effect of a raise on his taxes. He's getting a raise of $3,000, putting him into a higher tax bracket by $1,000 dollars. He's concerned about his entire income being taxed at 22% instead of 12%. Should he be concerned? Why or why not?    No, Fredrick should not be concerned. Only the $1000 will be taxed at 22%. The rest of his income will be taxed at a lower level.      A single person with taxable income of $95,000 will have the first $11,600 of that income taxed at what rate? Determine the taxes owed on just the first $11,600.    The first $11,600 will be taxed at 10% resulting in $1,160 owed in taxes.      A single person with taxable income of $185,000 will have the first $11,600 of that income taxed at a different rate than the income between $11,600 and $47,150. Determine the taxes owed on just the second bracket.    There is a total of $35,550 between $11,600 and $47,150. 12% of $35,550 is $4,266.      Using the simplified 2024 tax table, determine the income tax owed for a single person who has $90,000 of taxable income.    $90,000 falls into the third tax bracket. The first two brackets resulted in $5,426 and the third bracket has the excess over $47,150 being taxed at the higher rate of 22%. This results in a tax of $13,539.50.         Doug and Cindy are filing jointly. They owe $16,589 in taxes. Throughout the year they had $13,456 withheld from their paychecks, and they can claim an energy credit of $2,500 for purchasing a hybrid vehicle. Determine the amount they will need to pay or will get refunded.    $16,589 in taxes minus $13,456 for withholdings, and they can claim and $2,500 in credits. This leaves them owing $633.      Heather owes $7,589 in taxes. Throughout the year she had $6,456 withheld from her paychecks and she can claim an education credit of $1,980. Determine the amount she will need to pay or will get refunded.    $7,589 in taxes minus $6,456 for withholdings and education credit of $1,980. This leaves her refunded $847.      Determine the amount of taxes owed or the refund that would result in this situation:     Filing Status: Married filing jointly    Gross Income: $135,000    Adjustments: $5,600    Itemized Deductions: $19,400    Credits: $15,000     What is their adjusted gross income (AGI)?    Should they itemize or take the standard deduction?    Use the simplified 2018 tax tables to determine their taxes.    What is their final tax refund or amount still owed?             Take the income minus the adjustments . Their adjusted gross income is $129,400.    They should take the standard deduction because itemizing saves them less.    Taxable income:   Taxes owed:   They owe $12,150 in taxes.     Take the taxes owed minus credits and withholdings. They will receive a refund for $2,850.         Francis and Edward are planning to get married and they want to determine whether there is an advantage or disadvantage to marrying before the end of the year and filing their taxes jointly. Use the information below to calculate the amount they would owe or receive if they each filed as single, and the amount they would owe or receive if they filed jointly as a married couple. Which is the better choice?     Filing Status: TBD    Francis' Gross Income: $45,000    Edward's Gross Income: $50,000    Francis' Adjustments: $8,000    Edward's Adjustments: $4,000    Francis' Withholdings: $3,000    Edward's Withholdings: $3,500    Francis' Credits: $4,000    Edward's Credits: $1,000       SINGLE CASE:   Francis: Taxable Income     Tax from Table:     Owed\/Refund:       Edward: Taxable Income     Tax from Table:     Owed\/Refund:      Altogether, they will get a refund.  MARRIED CASE:   Taxable income:     Tax from Table:     Owed\/Refund:      Same either way! No marriage penalty unless it takes away credits.      Janice is unmarried and has two kids which allows her to file as head of household. She earned $96,000 in wages last year, received $850 in interest from a savings account, and contributed $26,000 to a tax deferred savings account. Her itemized deductions are $22,600.     Determine Janice's gross income.    Determine Janice's adjusted gross income.    Should Janice take the standard deduction or itemize? Explain.    Determine Janice's taxable income.    If Janice has $4,000 in child tax credits and had $5,300 withheld for taxes from her wages, will Janice owe money, or will she receive a refund? Calculate the amount.          Gross Income:     Adjusted Gross Income:     She should take itemized deductions since they are greater than the standard deduction for head of household.    Taxable Income:     Tax from Table: . Owed\/Refund:   Janice will receive a refund of $3,841.        "

  "title": "Propositions and Logical Operators",
  "body": " Propositions and Logical Operators     Identify propositions.    Compose and interpret the negation of a statement.    Use logical connectors (and\/or) and conditional statements (if, then) in context.    Evaluate the truth value of compound statements in context.    Introduce mathematical symbols used for logical operations.      Propositions  The basic building block of symbolic logic is the proposition or statement . A proposition is a declarative sentence that can be meaningfully classified as either true or false. Such statements are unlike everyday sentences, which can be questions, commands, or expressions with unclear meanings. Propositions are used in symbolic logic because they remove any vagueness or implied meanings that might confuse the application of logical principles.    Which of the following are propositions?   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    Do you like turtles?    My cat       The first and second items are propositions. The third one is a question and the fourth is a phrase, so they are not. We are not concerned right now about whether a statement is true or false. We will come back to that later when we look at compound statements.    Arguments are made of one or more propositions (called premises ), along with a conclusion . Propositions may be negated , or combined with connectors (or operators ) like and , and or to make new propositions. Let's take a closer look at how negations and logical connectors are used to create more complex statements.    Negation (not)   One way to change a proposition is to use its negation , or opposite meaning. The word not is often used to negate a statement.    Write the negation of the following propositions.   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    The sky is not green.    Cars have wheels.          Negation: I am not reading a math book.    Negation: Math is not fun!    Negation: The sky is green (or not not green).    Negation: Cars do not have wheels.         Negation of Quantifiers  It is worth mentioning the quantifiers  all and some and how to negate them. If we were to make the statement, All students read this book, we could negate it by saying Not all students read this book or Some students don't read this book. Notice how this is very different from No students read this book.   If we were to negate, No students read this book, we could say, A student is reading this book, or even, Some students do read this book. It only takes one counterexample to negate an all or nothing statement and the phrases some do and some don't are often used for this purpose. The same concept applies to similar words like everyone, nobody, always and never.    Write two different negations of each statement.   All college students take psychology.    Dogs are never brown.          Negations: Not all college students take psychology, or, Some college students don't take psychology.    Negations: There are brown dogs, or, Some dogs are brown.       For the most part, we will deal with unquantified logic in this book.    Multiple Negations  It is possible to use more than one negation in a statement. If you've ever said something like, I can't not go, you are saying you will go. In fact, it's often used for emphasis or a slightly different meaning, that you really must go. If someone says, I don't disagree , they may be saying they don't exactly agree but the person has a point. A double negative is similar to multiplying two negative numbers which gives a positive result. Using a third negation would then be equivalent to a single negation.  Note that in some instances a negation word like no,  nobody, or nothing is used to emphasize rather than negate and this is called negative concord . For example, I ain't got no money, is not a double negative but rather an emphasis of not having any money. This is common across many varieties of English and other languages. You can read more about negative concord at this site . In general, use your judgment and context cues to distinguish between a double negative and negative concord. We will use multiple negations but not negative concord in this book.  In the media and in ballot measures we often see multiple negations and it can be confusing to figure out what a statement means.    Read the statement and determine the outcome of a yes vote.   Vote for this measure to repeal the ban on plastic bags.     If you said that a yes vote would enable plastic bag usage, you are correct. The ban stopped plastic bag usage, so to repeal the ban would allow it again. This measure has a double negation and is also not very good for the environment.      Read the statement and determine the outcome on mandatory minimum sentencing.   The bill that overturned the ban on mandatory minimum sentencing was vetoed.     In this case mandatory minimum sentencing would not be allowed. The ban would stop it, and the bill to overturn it was vetoed. This is an example of a triple negation.       Logical Connectors: and and or  When we use the word and between two propositions, it connects them to create a new statement that is also a proposition. For example, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver and a wrench, then you are expressing the need for both tools. For an and statement to be true, the connected propositions must both be true. If even one proposition is false (for instance, you didn't need a wrench) then the entire connected statement is false.  The word or between two propositions similarly connects the propositions to create a new statement. In this case, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver or a wrench, then you are expressing the need for one of the tools (but probably not both). For an or statement to be true, at least one of the propositions must be true (or both could be true).    Determine whether each compound statement is true or false.   Six is an even number and Olympia is the capital of Washington.    Six is an even number or Olympia is the capital of Washington.    Guitars have strings and cats do not have whiskers.    Guitars have strings or cats do not have whiskers.    Whales are not mammals and spiders have ten legs.    Whales are not mammals or spiders have ten legs.          True. Six is even and Olympia is the capital of Washington. Since both parts are true, the and statement is true.    True. Since both parts are true, the or statement is true.    False. Guitars have strings but cats do have whiskers. Both statements must be true for an and statement to be true.    True. Since the first part is true, the or statement is true.    False. Whales are mammals and spiders have eight legs, so both parts are false, making the and statement false.    False. Neither of the parts are true, so the or statement is false.       In English we often mean for or to be exclusive : one or the other, but not both. For example, when you order at a restaurant and are offered a soup or salad with your meal, you understand the or to be exclusive: you may choose a salad or a soup with your meal but not both. In math, however, or is usually inclusive : one or the other, or both. The thing we are including, or excluding is the both option.    Determine whether each or statement is inclusive or exclusive.   Would you like a chicken or vegan meal?    We want to hire someone who speaks Spanish or Chinese.    Are you going to wear sandals or tennis shoes?    Are you going to visit Thailand or Vietnam on your trip?       The first or statement is a choice of one or the other, but not both, so it is exclusive. The second statement is inclusive because they could find a candidate who speaks both languages. The third statement is exclusive because you can't wear both at the same time. The fourth statement is inclusive because you could visit both countries on your trip.      Conditional Statements: if, then  A conditional statement connects two propositions using if, then . An example of a conditional statement is If it is raining, then we'll go to the mall. The first part of the statement following if is called the hypothesis or the antecedent . The second part following then is called the conclusion or the consequent .  The statement, It is raining, may be true or false for any given day. If the hypothesis is true, then we will follow the course of action and go to the mall. If the hypothesis is false, though, we haven't said anything about what we will or won't do.   Tip  To better understand the conditional, think of it as a promise. A promise is false only if it is broken; otherwise, it is true.   To understand the truth values for a conditional statement it is helpful to look at an example. Let's say a friend tells you, If you post that photo on social media, you'll lose your job. Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?  There are four possible outcomes:   You post the photo and lose your job.    You post the photo and don't lose your job.    You don't post the photo and lose your job.    You don't post the photo and don't lose your job.     The only case where you can say your friend was wrong is the second case, in which you post the photo but still keep your job. This is the only time when a conditional statement is false.  Your friend didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't post the photo, so you can't say the last two statements are wrong. Even if you didn't post the photo and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn't post it.  It may be helpful to outline the possibilities and outcomes of this example in a table. The four cases above correspond to the four rows of a truth table , a tool which will be covered in . For this table we will use for posting the photo, and for losing your job.     Posting the Photo (P)  Losing Your Job (L)  If P , then L    You post the photo (T)  You lose your job (T)  True    You post the photo (T)  You don't lose your job (F)  False    You don't post the photo (F)  You lose your job (T)  True    You don't post the photo (F)  You don't lose your job (F)  True    If the hypothesis (the if part) is false, we cannot say that the statement is a lie, so the result of the third and fourth rows is true. Notice that we are using a double negation in this explanation.    Determine whether each conditional statement is true or false.   If tricycles have three wheels, then bicycles have two wheels.    If tricycles have three wheels, then tricycles can fly.    If pigs can fly, then birds can fly.    If pigs can fly, then the sky is yellow.          True. Tricycles have three wheels and bicycles have two wheels. The hypothesis and conclusion are both true, so the statement is true.    False. Tricycles have three wheels, but they cannot fly. The hypothesis is true but the conclusion is false, making the statement false.    True. Pigs cannot fly (on their own) but birds can. Since the hypothesis is false, the statement is true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false.    True. Since the hypothesis is false, the statement is true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false.         Mathematical Notation for Logic  The truth values for simple logical statements are often apparent. However, the truth value of a proposition composed of multiple connected propositions is harder to determine. Mathematical notation can help because it allows the reader to focus on the logical structure of a compound statement rather than the unnecessary details.  There are many symbols that can be used interchangeable to represent logical connections and ideas. Not all of the options are presented here. Typically, propositions are represented using lowercase letters like or . In this text, we will sometimes use capital letters for clarity.  Sometimes it is convenient to use all capitalized words to represent logical connectors. For example, the use of AND instead of and or XOR to indicate that the or used is exclusive emphasizes that the word is being used in its strict logical sense. This is common in fields like computer science. In mathematical contexts, symbols like those shown in the following table are common.   Common Logical Symbols  logical symbols    Operator  Symbols Used    NOT     AND     OR     XOR     conditional     equivalent     This table is not exhaustive. This book will typically use , , , and to represent NOT (negation), AND, OR (inclusive), and if then (implication).      Exercises    Which of the following are propositions?     Pigs can fly.

  "body": " Truth Tables     Translate between English sentences and symbolic notation.    Use truth tables to find truth values of basic statements.    Use truth tables to find truth values of complex statements.      Truth Tables   In logic we can use a truth table to analyze a complex statement by summarizing all the possibilities and their truth values (true or false). To do this, we break the statement down to its smallest elements, the propositions. We can then see the outcome of the complex statement for all possible combinations of true and false for the propositions.  For example, suppose we have the following two propositions:    R : You paid your rent this month.     E : You paid your electric bill this month.     We use these two propositions to demonstrate the truth tables for not, and, and or. Before reading on, make sure you have reviewed the logical symbols shown in the block of .    To set up a truth table, we list all the possible truth value combinations in a systematic way. One way to do this is to make the first column half true, then half false, then cut the pattern in half with each succeeding column. For two propositions, the first two columns are shown to the right.              T  T     T  F     F  T     F  F      The four possible combinations are   Row 1: You have paid your rent and electric bill.    Row 2: You have paid your rent but not your electric bill.    Row 3: You have not paid your rent but you have paid your electric bill.    Row 4: You haven't paid either your rent or electric bill (yet).     Once we fill in the starting columns, we add additional columns for the more complex statements. We can add as many columns as needed. Below are the basic truth tables for not, and, and or.     Truth Tables for NOT, AND, and OR    Not : In the column, the truth value is the opposite of the value for . For example, if is true (you paid your rent) then (you did not pay your rent) is false.        T  F    F  T       And : In the column, you must have paid both your rent and electric bill. Otherwise is false.         T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  F       Or : In the column, you must have paid either your rent or electric bill, or both (inclusive or). Otherwise is false.         T  T  T    T  F  T    F  T  T    F  F  F       Truth Tables for the Conditional  To understand the truth table values for a conditional statement it is really helpful to look at it in context. We used this example in and we'll summarize it again here. Let's say a friend tells you, If you post that photo to social media, you'll lose your job. Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?  There are four possible outcomes:   You post the photo and lose your job.    You post the photo and don't lose your job.    You don't post the photo and lose your job.    You don't post the photo and don't lose your job.     The only case where you can say your friend was wrong is the second case, in which you post the photo but still keep your job.   Remember  To better understand the conditional, think of it as a promise. A promise is false only if it is broken; otherwise, it is true.   Your friend didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't post the photo, so you can't say the last two statements are wrong. Even if you didn't post the photo and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn't post it.  The four cases above correspond to the four rows of the truth table. For this truth table we will use for posting the photo, and for losing your job.     If, then : In the (read If , then ) column, the only outcome that is false is if you post the photo and don't lose your job. Otherwise is true.         T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  T    F  F  T     If the hypothesis (the if part) is false, we cannot say that the statement is a lie, so the result of the third and fourth rows is true. Notice that we are using a double negation in this explanation.     Truth Tables for Complex Statements  Truth tables really become useful when we seek to analyze complex statements composed of multiple propositions. To do so, we need truth tables with several columns. A good basic strategy in solving such problems is to work from the inside out and create a column in the table for each intermediate statement. Each intermediate statement (and hence column) should require only a single logical operation to compute. This can be tedious for long problems but guards against error.    Create a truth table for the statement .     When we create the truth table, we start with columns for the propositions, and . Then we add a column for because that is part of the final statement. Our last column is the final statement . It is temping to skip the column for and hold that intermediate value in your head as you compute . Resist this urge as skipping intermediate steps leads often leads to errors in logic later in a complex problem.          T  T      T  F      F  T      F  F        To complete the third column, not B , we take the opposite of the B column. Then to complete the fourth column, we only look at the A and the not B columns and compare them using or .          T  T  F  T    T  F  T  T    F  T  F  F    F  F  T  T         Truth Tables with Three Propositions  To create a truth table with three propositions we need eight rows to list all possible truth combinations. First, we will determine the columns we need to get to our final statement. Next, we will fill in the first three columns using the same methodology as before. Start with half true, half false, then cut the pattern in half each time.    Create a truth table for the statement .    First, write out the columns we need. We have , then we need the statement in the parentheses, . Then we need the negation of that column, . The last column we need is the final statement, .  Here is the initial table:            T  T  T       T  T  F       T  F  T       T  F  F       F  T  T       F  T  F       F  F  T       F  F  F       Now we complete the columns one at a time. We use the column and column to complete . Then, is the opposite of that column. For the final column we only need to look at the first and fifth columns, shaded in blue, with AND. Here is the completed table.            T  T  T  T  F  F    T  T  F  T  F  F    T  F  T  T  F  F    T  F  F  F  T  T    F  T  T  T  F  F    F  T  F  T  F  F    F  F  T  T  F  F    F  F  F  F  T  F    For this statement must be true and neither nor can be true, so is only true in the fourth row.    Perhaps the last example seems theoretical. What kind of application might require this kind of logic? For an application, consider the following propositions taken from professional baseball:  Let Anaheim wins, Baltimore wins, and Cleveland wins. Suppose that Anaheim will make the playoffs if: (1) Anaheim wins, and (2) neither Baltimore nor Cleveland wins. When will Anaheim make the playoffs? Only in the case that the statement is true! As we saw above, TFF ( T, F, and F) is the only scenario in which Anaheim will make the playoffs.    Construct a truth table for the statement .    Here are the columns for the table:            T  T  T       T  T  F       T  F  T       T  F  F       F  T  T       F  T  F       F  F  T       F  F  F       For the fourth column, we take the opposite of . Then we use the first and fourth columns to complete . Next, we use columns five and three to complete our conditional statement. Be careful as we must read these columns right to left to get correct conditional values. Here is the completed table:            T  T  T  F  F  T    T  T  F  F  F  T    T  F  T  T  T  T    T  F  F  T  T  F    F  T  T  F  F  T    F  T  F  F  F  T    F  F  T  T  F  T    F  F  F  T  F  T    When is true, is false, and is false—the fourth row of the table—then the hypothesis will be true, but the conclusion ( ) is false, resulting in an invalid conditional statement; every other case gives a true result.    Again, this result might seem very abstract. Here is a real-life situation that could be modeled by .  Suppose we order meatballs, we order pasta, and Ruba is happy. The statement is then, if we order meatballs and don't order pasta, then Ruba is happy . If is true (we order meatballs), is false (we don't order pasta), and is false (Ruba is not happy), then the statement is false, because we satisfied the premise, but Ruba did not satisfy the conclusion. In all other cases the statement is true.   "

  "body": " Equivalence     Determine whether statements are logically equivalent.    Use equivalent forms of the conditional interchangeably.    Show statement are equivalent using truth tables.      Two statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in every possible situation. In other words, no matter the circumstances, both statements are either true or false simultaneously. This relationship is often denoted symbolically, and means that statements and are interchangeable in logical arguments.    Logical Equivalence and the Conditional  It may seem counterintuitive at first, but the conditional statement if p, then q ( ) can be written using negation and an OR statement. To be precise,         To understand this intuitively, consider the following example. Keep in mind that symbolic logic cannot represent the English language example, and we may need to change verb tenses or otherwise rephrase to make equivalent forms clear. (For a review of the conditional, re-read .)   You are told If the cookies contains nuts, then Alex cannot eat it . With some thought, you should see that this is equivalent to saying Either the cake does not contain nuts, or Alex cannot eat it .   While verbal example such as the one above illustrate our intuitive understanding that two statements are equivalent, equivalence is definitively demonstrated with a truth table. One advantage of a truth table is that the result can be shown independently of the specific details of a problem.    Use a truth table to show that .    We build a truth table as shown in . Begin by adding the standard columns for and , then continue by adding a third column for using column 1. Next, compute using columns 3 and 2. We end by adding a column for using columns 1 and 2.           T  T  F  T  T    T  F  F  F  F    F  T  T  T  T    F  F  T  T  T    Observe that the truth values in columns 4 and 5 match exactly. This demonstrates the equivalence of with .    The negation of a conditional also has an equivalent form written using AND. That is,         Can you demonstrate this equivalence using a truth table? Doing so is very similar to the previous example. The intuitive sense of the above logical statement is illustrated by the following example.    Consider the statement If you park here, then you will get a ticket. What set of conditions would prove this statement false?    You don't park here and you get a ticket.    You don't park here and you don't get a ticket.    You park here and you don't get a ticket.      The first two statements are irrelevant because we don't know what will happen if you park somewhere else. The third statement, however contradicts the conditional statement If you park here, then you will get a ticket because you parked here but didn't get a ticket.  This example demonstrates the general rule shown above that the negation of a conditional can be written as a conjunction: It is not the case that if you park here, then you will get a ticket is equivalent to You park here and you do not get a ticket.       The Contrapositive   And and or statements can have their propositions reversed without affecting the truth value of the statement. If you need to buy beans and eggs, that's the same as buying eggs and beans. The order does matter for a conditional statement, however. Sometimes during an argument, an if, then statement will be reversed or combined with not in different ways. There are names for these combinations and it is helpful to look at which statements are equivalent to each other. Here are the names for the different combinations of if, then and not statements.      Original Conditional :      Converse :      Inverse :      Contrapositive :      The meaning of each of these forms is examined in the following example.    Assume this original conditional statement is true: If you take your dog to the park, they will be happy. Write the converse, inverse and contrapositive of the original statement and determine which are equivalent to each other.       Original Statement: is, You take your dog to the park, and q is, Your dog is happy.     Converse: If your dog is happy, then you took them to the park. Notice we needed to change the tense to keep the order of events the same. If your dog is happy does that mean you took them to the park? Not necessarily, because there are other reasons your dog could be happy like getting a treat or taking a walk. So, this is false.    Inverse: If you don't take your dog to the park, they will not be happy. This is similar to the converse. Even if you don't take your dog to the park, they could be unhappy for another reason. This is false. The inverse is logically equivalent to the converse.    Contrapositive: If your dog is not happy, then you did not take them to the park. Since the original statement is true, then this is also true. Taking your dog to the park would result in them being happy, so if they are not happy we can say that they did not go to the park. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.       The above example provides intuition for the following fact.   Logical Equivalence of the Contrapositive   A conditional statement and its contrapositive are equivalent. The converse and inverse of a conditional statement are also equivalent. That is, However, is NOT equivalent to .      Use a truth table to demonstrate the equivalence of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. That is, verify that     Here is a truth table with a column for each piece of the statement.            T  T  T  F  F  T    T  F  F  T  F  F    F  T  T  F  T  T    F  F  T  T  T  T    Note that columns three and five show the same truth values. This demonstrates the equivalence of the conditional with its contrapositive.      The Biconditional  In everyday life, we often have a stronger meaning in mind when we use a conditional statement. Consider the statement If you submit your hours today, then you will be paid next Friday. What the payroll representative really means is If you submit your hours today, then you will be paid next Friday, and if you don't submit your hours today, then you won't be paid next Friday. In this example, the conditional statement if , then also includes the (unspoken!) inverse of the statement: if not , then not . A more compact way to express this statement is You will be paid next Friday if and only if you submit your timesheet today. A statement of this form is called a biconditional .   Because a biconditional statement is equivalent to , we can think of it as a conditional statement combined with its converse: if , then and if , then . The double-headed arrow shows that the conditional statement goes from left to right and from right to left. A biconditional is considered true as long as the antecedent and the consequent have the same truth value; that is, they are either both true or both false.         T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  F      Biconditional  biconditional  A biconditional is a logical conditional statement in which the antecedent and consequent are interchangeable.  A biconditional is written as and is read as if and only if .     Suppose this statement is true: The garbage truck comes down my street if and only if it is Thursday morning. Which of the following statements could be true?   It is noon on Thursday and the garbage truck did not come down my street this morning.    It is Monday, and the garbage truck is coming down my street.    It is Wednesday at 11:59PM and the garbage truck did not come down my street today.          This cannot be true. This is like the second row of the truth table; it is true that I just experienced Thursday morning, but it is false that the garbage truck came.    This cannot be true. This is like the third row of the truth table; it is false that it is Thursday, but it is true that the garbage truck came.    This could be true. This is like the fourth row of the truth table; it is false that it is Thursday, but it is also false that the garbage truck came, so everything worked out like it should.       As shown in the next example, the biconditional can be used in truth table problems as seen in .    Create a truth table for the statement .    We start by listing all the possible truth value combinations for , and . After creating those three columns, we create a fourth column for the antecedent, , whose values we find by temporarily ignoring the column for and focusing on and . Next, we can create a column for the negation of . Finally, we find the truth values of . Remember, a biconditional is true when the truth value of the two parts match, but it is false when the truth values do not match. The resulting table is shown below.            T  T  T  T  F  F    T  T  F  T  T  T    T  F  T  T  F  F    T  F  F  T  T  T    F  T  T  T  F  F    F  T  F  T  T  T    F  F  T  F  F  T    F  F  F  F  T  F        De Morgan's Laws  In 1847 Augustus De Morgan published two rules of logic that had previously been known only informally. These rules allow us to rewrite the negation of an AND statement with OR, and the negation of an OR statement with AND.  To illustrate the intuitive sense of De Morgan's Law , suppose you want to schedule a meeting with two colleagues at 4:30PM on Friday, and you need both of them to be available at that time. What situation would make it impossible to have the meeting? That is, what would it mean if it were not the case that Colleague A and Colleague B could both meet? Writing this in logic, what is equivalent to ? This situation is equivalent to either Colleague A not being available or Colleague B being not being available. That is, (again writing the result in logic) is an equivalent form.   De Morgan's Law  De Morgan's law  logical rules De Morgan's Law   For any two propositions and , De Morgan's Law can be demonstrated using truth tables. This demonstration is left as a homework exercises.     "

  "body": " Arguments     Understand the structure of logical arguments by identifying the premise(s) and conclusion.    Translate between symbolic logic and natural language.    Distinguish between deductive and inductive arguments.    Determine the validity and soundness of a deductive argument.    Recognize valid logical forms.      A logical argument is a claim that a set of propositions, called premises or hypotheses , support a proposition called the conclusion . In this section we will look at inductive and deductive arguments and how to determine the strength, validity, and\/or soundness of each. We will use truth tables as our primary tool for determining the validity of deductive arguments, but will also list several standard argument forms.    Inductive and Deductive Arguments  The two types of arguments presented in this section are inductive and deductive arguments. It is important to understand the difference between these two types because the analysis we apply is quite different. To better understand the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, let us begin by looking at a couple of examples.   To analyze an argument is is helpful to precisely state its premises and conclusion. Most arguments you encounter in the real world won't be stated in a precise premise, premise, conclusion form. Sometimes the conclusion will be stated before the premises, or the premises will be hidden within a bunch of rhetoric.    Consider the following argument:   When I went to the store last week, I forgot my wallet, and I forgot it again when I went back today. I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.   To begin our analysis of this first argument, let's first rewrite it in a more precise premise, premise, conclusion form.    P1:  I forgot my wallet when I went to the store last week.    P2:  I forgot my wallet when I went to the store today.    C:  I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.    Notice that both premises make a claim about a specific instance - the specific instance last week when I forgot my wallet, and the specific instance today when I forgot my wallet. The conclusion, on the other hand, states what we can expect to happen more generally.   Now let's consider a different argument. As you read it, think about how it differs from the previous example.   Argument:   Henry must know CPR because he is a nurse and all nurses know CPR.   Just as we did for the last example, rewrite the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form for clarity:    P1:  All nurses know CPR.    P2:  Henry is a nurse.    C:  Henry knows CPR.    Unlike the first argument where the premises were specific and the conclusion was general, this argument's first premise is a general statement and the conclusion is specific.   We can determine whether an argument is inductive or deductive by looking at which part of the argument is general and which is specific. In the first example, the premises were specific and the conclusion was more general. This is an example of an inductive argument. In the second example, it was the premises that were more general and the conclusion that was specific. This is an example of a deductive argument.  In general, an inductive argument uses a collection of specific examples (i.e. data) as its premises and uses them to propose a general conclusion. This is shown in the image on the left below, where the argument moves from the narrow specific premises at the bottom up to the wide general conclusion at the top. A deductive argument uses a collection of general statements (i.e. definitions) as its premises and uses them to propose a specific conclusion . This is shown in the image to the right below, where the argument moves from the wide general premises at the bottom to the narrow specific conclusion at the top.    A pyramid upside down with the narrow end at the bottom for a specific premise, the middle section is another specific premise; the wide part at the top is for the general conclusion    A pyramid right-side up with the wide base at the bottom for a general premise; another general premise in the middle section, and a specific conclusion in the narrow part at the top      Rewrite the following arguments in a precise premise, premise, conclusion > form, and determine if the argument is inductive or deductive.   A number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and one. Since the number 13 is only divisible by itself and one, 13 must be prime.    Juan's dog Goober is having puppies. All three of Goober's previous litters have had 5 puppies so Goober is bound to have 5 puppies in this litter as well.            P1:  If a number is only divisible by itself and one, the number is prime.    P2:  The number 13 is only divisible by itself and one.    C:  13 is prime.    Since the premises are general definitions and properties of numbers and the conclusion is a specific statement about the number 13, the argument is deductive .      P1:  Goober is having puppies.    P2:  Goober's last three litters had 5 puppies.    C:  Goober's current litter will have 5 puppies.    This is an example of an inductive argument since it uses specific experiences\/instances as its premises, and its conclusion is a general expectation based on those specific experiences.         Evaluating Arguments  Inductive arguments cannot be proven. The best we can do is evaluate the strength of the argument based on the evidence it provides.  A strong inductive argument is one that is well supported by its premises, while a weak inductive argument is one whose premises do a poor job of supporting the conclusion. The strength of an inductive argument is subjective, because where one person sees a strong argument, another may see a weak argument. Additionally, the strength and truth of an argument are not necessarily related; it is possible to have a weak argument that is true, and a strong argument that is false.    Determine the strength of the inductive argument.   James Franco, Jodie Foster, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jack Nicholson have all won Academy Awards for acting. Actors whose names start with J are bound to win an Academy Award.     The inductive argument provides a number of specific cases as evidence for the conclusion. However, we would not be surprised if a J-named actor did not win an Academy Award, so the argument is weak.    Deductive arguments, on the other hand, can be proven and their validity and soundness can be evaluated. The validity of the argument is based on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, while the soundness of the argument is based on whether or not the premises are true. An argument cannot be sound if it is not valid, even if the premises seem reasonable.    Evaluating Deductive Arguments Using Truth Tables  There are various ways to evaluate deductive logical arguments. Our focus here will be the use of truth tables. In this method, the verbal argument is translated into mathematical notation and all possible truth values of the statement are organized in a table. The argument is valid when the conclusion is true whenever all premises are true, and invalid when there is at least one scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. The advantage of this method is that it requires no knowledge of logical forms. However, it can be tedious for complicated problems, especially those requiring more than 2 or 3 propositions.    Suppose each of the following statements are true:  Either the security system was activated or the alarm went off, but not both.  The alarm did not go off.  Prove that \"The security system was activated.\"    First, define the necessary logical variables:  Let = The security system was activated  Let = The alarm went off  The first statement can be written as: , which is more simply written using the symbol for the exclusive OR . Similarly, the second statement may be written as , and the conclusion is simply . In its briefest form, the argument is thus    P1:  ,    P2:  ,    C:  .    To evaluate this argument we need a truth table with columns for , , , and .    C:   P1:  P2:    T  T  F  F    T  F  T  T    F  T  T  F    F  F  F  T    To evaluate the argument, we ask if the conclusion is true every time the premises are true. Row two of the truth table shows this to be the case. P1 and P2 (columns 2 and 4) are true and the conclusion (first column) is true as well. Thus, this is a valid argument.    Here is an example requiring three proportions.    Suppose each of the following statements are true:  It is snowing.  If it is warm, then it is not snowing.  If it is not warm, then I cannot go swimming.  Prove: I cannot go swimming.    Begin by clearly defining the necessary logical variables:  Let = It is snowing.  Let = It is warm.  Let = I can go swimming.  You could of course write as the negative I cannot go swimming , but writing the statements without negatives reduces the confusion of potential double negatives later in a problem. Using these symbols, the argument can be summarized as:    P1:  ,    P2:  ,    P3:  ,    C:  .    Next, create a truth table for the above argument, where each premise and the conclusion appear in a column. Here is the table for this example.    P1:      C:  P2:  P3:    T  T  T  F  F  F  F  T    T  T  F  F  T  F  T  F    T  F  T  F  T  F  T  F    T  F  F  F  T  T  T  T    F  T  T  T  F  F  T  T    F  T  F  T  F  T  T  T    F  F  T  T  T  F  T  F    F  F  F  T  T  T  T  T     Row 4 of this table shows that the argument is valid. In this row, each of the 3 premises is true as is the conclusion.    Summary: Tabular Method  To test the validity of an argument (i.e. prove or disprove):  Write the verbal argument in symbolic form.  Draw a truth table where each premise and the conclusion gets its own column. Do this all in one (possibly large!) table.  Locate all rows where where all of the premises are true.  Look at each row from the previous step. Is the conclusion also true? If it is also true on each row, then the argument is valid (or true). Otherwise, the argument is not valid.     Even one instance where the premises are true and the conclusion false invalidates an argument. It does not matter if there is another row in the table where the premises are true and the conclusion is true. The next example illustrates an invalid argument.    Evaluate the validity of the following argument.   If taxes are cut, then retail sales increase. If retail sales increase, then the economy improves. Thus, if taxes are not cut, the economy will not improve.     First, define the necessary logical variables:  Let = Taxes are cut.  Let = Retail sales increase.  Let = The economy improves.  The argument is summarized symbolically as    P1:  ,    P2:  ,    C:  .    Next, create a truth table for the above argument. Make sure each premise and the conclusion appear in a column. Here we number the rows for easy reference, but in general this is not necessary.    row     P1:  P2:    C:    1  T  T  T  T  T  F  F  T    2  T  T  F  T  F  F  T  T    3  T  F  T  F  T  F  F  T    4  T  F  F  F  T  F  T  T    5  F  T  T  T  T  T  F  F    6  F  T  F  T  F  T  T  T    7  F  F  T  T  T  T  F  F    8  F  F  F  T  T  T  T  T    Notice that in rows 1 and 8 each premise and the conclusion are true. This might make you think the argument is valid. However, in rows 5 and 7 the premises are true but the conclusion is false! This demonstrates that the argument is invalid . To be valid every row where the premises are true must have a true conclusion as well.     is invalid because it commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent (or fallacy of the inverse ), which is based on the mistaken assumption that a conditional and its inverse are equivalent, as described in . Even with the premises being true, the economy could still improve for reasons completely unrelated to tax cuts and retail sales. If you are interested in learning more about common logical fallacies, consider reading the next section of this chapter, .    Forms of Valid Arguments (Optional)   Evaluating arguments by truth table is accurate and powerful, it can be tedious and exhausting to make them. Also, it is sometimes redundant, as arguments about different topics may have the same logical form. If we are able to recognize certain common forms of arguments as valid (or invalid), we can evaluate validity without the tedium of creating a table. The following is a sampling of valid logical forms. Invalid logical forms (or fallacies ) are discussed in .    The Law of Detachment  Also called by its Latin name, Modus Ponens ( mode that affirms ), the law of detachment applies when a conditional and its antecedent are given as premises, and the consequent is the conclusion. The general form is:    P1:  ,    P2:  ,    C:  .     The Law of Detachment  law of detachment  logical rules detachment   If the conditional is true and is true, then must be true.      If you bought bread, then you went to the store. You bought bread. Therefore, you went to the store.   This argument has the structure described by the law of detachment: the second premise and the conclusion are simply the two parts of the first premise detached from each other. Instead of making a truth table, we can say that this argument is valid by stating that it satisfies the law of detachment.     The Law of Contraposition  The law of contraposition applies when a conditional and the negation of its consequent are given as premises, and the negation of its antecedent is the conclusion. This form is also called Modus Tollens ( mode that denies ). The general form is:    P1:  ,    P2:  ,    C:  .     The Law of Contraposition  law of contraposition  logical rules contraposition   If the conditional is true and is true, then must be true.    Notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the contrapositive of the first premise, , but they have been detached. Think of the law of contraposition as a combination of the law of detachment and the fact that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.    If I drop my phone into the swimming pool, my phone will be ruined. My phone isn't ruined. Therefore, I didn't drop my phone into the swimming pool.   The form of this argument matches what we need to invoke the law of contraposition, so it is a valid argument.     The Transitive Property  The transitive property (or Hypothetical Syllogism ) has as its premises a series of conditionals, where the consequent of one is the antecedent of the next. The conclusion is a conditional with the same antecedent as the first premise and the same consequent as the final premise. In other words, the transitive property describes a chain reaction: if the first thing happens, then the second thing happens, and if the second thing happens, then the third thing happens. Therefore, if we want to ignore the second thing, we can say that if the first thing happens, then we know the third thing will happen. The general form is:    P1:  ,    P2:  ,    C:  .     The Transitive Property  transitive property  logical rules transitivity   If the conditional is true and the conditional is true, then must be true.      If a soccer player commits a reckless foul, she will receive a yellow card. If Hayley receives a yellow card, she will be suspended for the next match. Therefore, if Hayley commits a reckless foul, she will be suspended for the next match.   This argument has the exact structure required to use the transitive property, so it is a valid argument.

  "title": "Logical Fallacies",
  "body": " Logical Fallacies      Identify common logical fallacies and their use in arguments.      In the last section we saw that logical arguments are invalid when the premises are not sufficient to guarantee the conclusion, and that even if an argument is valid it may be unsound if the premises are not true. There are other ways that a logical argument my by invalid or unsound. One of the more common ways this can occur is if the argument is a fallacy .  A fallacy is a type of argument that appears valid but uses a logical error to persuade or deceive. Fallacious arguments are especially common in advertising and politics, so it is important as informed citizens to recognize when we are being presented with a fallacious argument and to not be persuaded by it.    Common Logical Fallacies   There are many logical fallacies, and some go by more than one name. Below we introduce a few of the more common fallacies that you will be asked to recognize by name, but there are many others.    Personal Attack (Ad hominem)  A personal attack argument attacks the person making the argument while ignoring the argument itself. A personal attack is not the same as an insult. Rather, a personal attack claims that there is something wrong with the person or group in order to cast doubt on their character and discredit their argument.    Jane says that whales are fish, but she's only in the second grade so she can't be right.   Here the argument is attacking Jane, not the validity of her claim, so this is a personal attack.     Jane says that whales are fish, but everyone knows that they're really mammals. She's so stupid.   This certainly isn't very nice, but it is not a personal attack since a valid counterargument is made ( they really are mammals ) along with a personal insult.     Mr. Smith is a college dropout, so his stance on education reform cannot be trusted.   Here the argument uses the fact that Mr. Smith did not complete their college degree to discredit their ideas on education reform, so it is a personal attack.     Appeal to Ignorance  An appeal to ignorance argument assumes something is true because it hasn't been proven false.    Nobody has proven that photo isn't of Bigfoot, so it must be Bigfoot.   This is an example of an appeal to ignorance since the fact that no one has been able to prove the picture of Bigfoot is false is being used as evidence that it is Bigfoot.     Appeal to Authority  An appeal to authority argument attempts to use the authority of a person to prove a claim. An authority could be an expert such as a doctor or scholar, or someone who is admired like a celebrity or sports figure. While an authority can provide strength to an argument, problems can occur when the person's opinion is not shared by other experts, or when the authority is irrelevant to the claim.    A diet high in bacon can be healthy; Doctor Atkins said so.   Here, an appeal to a doctor's authority is used for the argument. This generally would provide strength to the argument, except that the opinion that eating a diet high in saturated fat runs counter to general medical opinion. More supporting evidence would be needed to justify this claim.     Jennifer Hudson and Oprah lost weight with Weight Watchers, so their program must work.   In this example there is an appeal to the authority of celebrities. While their experience does provide evidence, it provides no more than any other person's experience would.     False Dilemma  A false dilemma argument falsely frames an argument as an either or choice without allowing for additional options.    Either those lights in the sky were an airplane or aliens. There are no airplanes scheduled for tonight, so it must be aliens.   This argument is a false dilemma since it ignores the possibility that the lights could be something other than an airplane or aliens.     Straw Man  A straw man argument involves misrepresenting the argument in an oversimplified, distorted and less favorable way to make it easier to attack.    Senator Khouri has proposed reducing military spending by 10%. Apparently, she wants to leave us defenseless against attacks by terrorists.   Here the arguer has represented a 10% funding cut as equivalent to leaving us defenseless, making it easier to attack Senator Khouri's position.     Post Hoc  A post hoc argument claims that because two things happened sequentially, then the first must have caused the second.    Every morning the rooster crows just before dawn. It must be his crow that makes the sun rise.   Here the arguer is saying the rooster caused the sun to rise, but it is more likely that the sun rising caused the rooster to crow.     Today I wore a red shirt and my football team won! I need to wear a red shirt every time they play to make sure they keep winning.   This person is saying their team won because they wore a red shirt. This type of superstition is quite common in sports even though we really know they are unrelated.     Sometimes there may be more than one fallacy that seems reasonable. Consider this argument: Emma Watson says she's a feminist, but she posed for these racy pictures. I'm a feminist and no self-respecting feminist would do that. Could this be ad hominem, saying that Emma Watson has no self-respect? Could it be appealing to authority because the person making the argument claims to be a feminist? Could it be a false dilemma because the argument assumes that a woman is either a feminist or not, with no gray area in between?  We have described just six of the many types of logical fallacies. Once you learn to recognize these you will also likely become aware of many others. There are many lists of logical fallacies online.     Exercises    Determine which type of fallacy each argument represents.     John Bardeen's work at the Advanced Institute for Physics has progressed so slowly that even his colleagues call him a plodder. Hence, it is prudent at present not to take seriously his current theory relating how strings constitute the smallest of subatomic particles.    Personal attack      You will tell the general manager that I made the right choice in dealing with that customer. After all, I'm the shift manager, so my decisions are always right.    Appeal to authority      It was his fault, Officer. You can tell by the kind of car I'm driving and by my clothes that I am a good citizen and would not lie. Look at the rattletrap he is driving and look at how he is dressed. You can't believe anything a dirty, longhaired hippie like that might tell you. Search his car; he probably has pot in it.    Personal Dilemma      We can go to the amusement park or the library. The amusement park is too expensive, so we must go to the library.    False dilemma      Nearly all heroin addicts used marijuana before trying heroin. Clearly marijuana use leads to heroin addiction.    Post Hoc      The oven was working fine until you started using it, so you must have broken it.    Post Hoc      Old man Brown claims that he saw a flying saucer in his farm, but he never got beyond the fourth grade in school and can hardly read or write. He is completely ignorant of what scientists have written on the subject, so his report cannot possibly be true.    Personal Attack      You should use Sparkle brand toothpaste since four out of five dentists recommend it.    Appeal to authority      She didn't say that I couldn't borrow her car, so I figured it was fine if I borrowed it for the weekend.    Appeal to ignorance      If you think that teens should be taught about contraceptive measures then you want to give kids license to have sex with no consequences.    Straw person      You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.    False dilemma      No one can prove that God exists, therefore God does not exist.    Appeal to ignorance      You're clearly just too young to understand.    Personal attack      You should start off every morning with Champions brand cereal. It is what Michael Jordan eats, so you know that it must be very good for you.    Appeal to authority      No one on the council objected to the idea that he proposed, so everyone must think it is a good idea.    Appeal to ignorance      Why should we believe your testimony? You haven't had a steady job since 2003.    Personal attack      A huge percentage of diagnosed cases of autism came very soon after vaccinations for the measles. These vaccinations must be causing autism.    Post Hoc      If you are against this war then you must hate America.    Straw person      Just look at her face. How could anyone vote for that?    Personal Attack       There are a number of fallacies that were not discussed in this section. Do an internet search for the following fallacies. Provide both a definition and at least one example.   Slippery Slope    Circular Reasoning    Appeal to Emotion    Red Herring    Whataboutism       Answers will vary.     "

  "body": " Sets and Set Operations     Use set notation and understand the null set    Determine the universal set for a given context    Perform basic set operations (union, intersection, and complement).    Use Venn diagrams and set notation to illustrate the intersection, union and complements of sets      The idea of a set allows us to treat distinct objects as a single entity. For example, we could use to represent the four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. That is, By classifying items as groups (sets), we can also investigate relationships between groups, or consider overlap between groups when counting items.    A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called the elements (or members ) of the set.      Set Notation  A set can be defined by describing the contents, or by listing the elements of the set, enclosed in curly brackets. Symbolically, sets are represented using capital letters and braces { } are used to enclose the sets elements. The method of listing the elements of a set in braces is called roster notation. A second method is to use set-builder notation , where braces and a vertical line | (read such that ) is used to describe the contents of a set.   Describing a set by its contents:   The set of all even numbers.    The seasons of the year     Roster notation:              Set builder notation:                 Julia, Keenan, Jae and Colin took a test. They got the following scores: 70, 95, 85 and 70. Let be the set of test takers and be the set of test scores. List the elements of each set using set notation.    In this example, the set of people taking the test is , and the set of test scores is . Notice in this example that even though two people scored a 70 on the test, the score of 70 is only listed once.    Sometimes a collection might not contain all the elements of a set. For example, suppose Chris owns three Madonna albums. While Chris's collection is a set, we can also say it is a subset of the larger set of all Madonna albums.    Let and be two sets. Then is a subset of , written , if and only if every element of is also an element of .      Let and be two sets. We say that is a equal to , written , if and only if and . That is, and contain the same elements.     Consider the three sets Then each of the following set relationships is true:              It is possible to have a set with nothing in it. This set called the null set or empty set . It is like going to the grocery store to buy your favorite foods and realizing you left your wallet at home. You walk away with an empty bag. The set of items that you bought at the grocery store would written in set notation as . The empty set is a subset of every set.  In applications of sets the elements that may be considered are often limited to some context or universe of discourse . This context is called the universal set and is the set containing every possible element of the described context. Every set is thus a subset of the universal set. The universal set is often labeled with a capital letter .  When represented visually, the universal set is often illustrated by a rectangle labeled with a capital letter U . Subsets of the universal set are usually illustrated with circles for simplicity, but other shapes can be used. The visual representation of sets is further discussed in .    The set that contains no elements is called the empty set and is denoted .      The universal set  is defined to be the set of all elements under consideration.     What contents of the universal set depends on context and is sometime subject to interpretation. Here are some examples.      If you are searching for books for a research project, the universal set might be all the books in the library, and the books in the library that are relevant to your research project would be a subset of the universal set.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all books in the library; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled books relevant to your research project.        If you are wanting to create a group of your Facebook friends that are coworkers, the universal set would be all your Facebook friends and the group of coworkers would be a subset of the universal set.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all your facebook friends; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled coworkers.        If you are working with sets of numbers, the universal set might be all whole numbers, and all prime numbers would be a subset of the universal set.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all whole numbers; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled all whole numbers.           Set Operations: Union, Intersection, and Complement  Suppose you and your roommate decide to have a house party, and you each invite your circle, or set, of friends. When you combine your two sets of friends, you discover that you have some friends in common.  The set of friends that you have in common is called the intersection . The intersection of two sets contains only the elements that are in both sets. To be in the intersection of set and , an element needs to be in both set  and set .   intersection  sets intersection   The intersection of two sets, and , denoted , the set containing all elements that are in both and . That is,     The set of all friends that you and your roommate have invited is called the union . The union of two sets contains all the elements contained in either set (or both). To be in the union of set A and set , an element must to be contained in just set , just set , or in the intersection of sets and . Notice that in this case that the or is inclusive .   union  sets union   The union of two sets, and , denoted , the set containing all elements that are in or in (or both). That is,     What about the people who were not invited to the party and showed up anyway? They are not elements of your set of invited friends. Nor are they an element of your roommate's set of invited friends. These uninvited party crashers are the complement to your set of invited friends. The complement of a set A contains everything that is not in the set . To be in the complement of set , an element cannot be in set , but it will be an element of the universal set.   complement  sets complement   The complement of a set in a universal set is the set consisting of all elements in that are not in . That is,    Note: The complement of a set may also be denoted by or .      Consider the sets: , , and .   Determine , and write it in set notation.    Determine , and write it in set notation.    Determine and write it in set notation.          The intersection contains the elements in both sets: .    The union contains all the elements in either set: . Notice we only list red once.    Here we are looking for all the elements that are not in set and are in set : .         Venn Diagrams   Venn diagrams are used to illustrate the relationships between two or more sets. To create a Venn diagram, start by drawing a rectangle to represent the universal set. Next draw and label overlapping circles to represent each of your sets. Most often there will be two or three sets illustrated in a Venn diagram. Finally, if you are given elements, fill in each region with its corresponding elements. Venn diagrams are also a great way to illustrate intersections, unions and complements of sets as shown below.   Venn diagram  universal set  sets Venn diagram  sets universal set   A Venn diagram is a picture used to represent sets and their relationships. Each set is represented by a circle, with the area inside the circle representing the elements that are in the set. The entire diagram is enclosed in a rectangle representing the set of all possible elements, called the universal set .      The intersection is where the shading of the two sets overlaps in the center. It contains the elements of A and B.   A Venn diagram of two overlapping sets, labeled set A and set B, with 3 regions; the crescent shape in yellow indicates the region for members who are only in set A; the crescent shape shaded blue indicates the members who are only in set B; the overlapping region in the middle is shaded green to indicate member in both sets; the green area is called the intersection      The union includes all elements of A or B or both. It contains all three of the shaded regions.   The same Venn diagram used to illustrate the union is all 3 regions      The complement of set A includes all the elements not in A. It is the shaded region outside the set of A, but within the universal set.   A Venn diagram with only one set A; The region outside the circle for A but inside the rectangle is shaded blue to represent the complement of the set or elements not in set A.       Constructing a Venn Diagram   Let and be subsets of the universal set . Draw a Venn diagram representing these sets.    Draw a box to represent and one circle for each of and , making sure that there is a region inside both circles. Then place the elements in the appropriate region as shown below.   Venn Diagram   A Venn Diagram with two circles, one for A and one for B, which overlap in the middle. Elements a and c are in circle A but not circle B, element f is in circle B but not circle A, elements d and e are in both circles, and element b is not in either circle.         Create a Venn diagram to illustrate .    The set contains all elements not in set . THis means that contains elements that are not in  and in . That is, it contains the elements of that are not in as shown in the following Venn Diagram.   A Venn diagram illustrating the set shaded in yellow.

  "body": " The Number of Elements in a Finite Set     Use the addition rule to count the number of elements in the union of two sets.    Count the number of elements needed to solve 3-set problems.      Counting is a core idea in mathematics, practiced since the dawn of history. Finite sets, with a specific number of distinct elements, are essential to this process. When dealing with two or three sets, we track elements that occur in multiple sets. Set operations—intersections, unions, and complements—are crucial tools for solving these counting problems.    Counting Problems with 2 Sets  The number of elements in a set is called the cardinality of the set. Sometimes we are interested in the cardinality of the union or intersection of sets, but not know the actual elements of each set. The following sections explore these ideas in problems involving two or three sets.    The number of elements in a set is called the cardinality of the set. The cardinality of set is denoted or .     A survey asks 200 people What beverage do you drink in the morning , and offers choices:   Tea only,    Coffee only,    Both coffee and tea.   Suppose 20 report tea only, 80 report coffee only, 40 report both. How many people drink tea in the morning? How many people drink neither tea or coffee?   This question can be most easily answered by creating a Venn diagram. We see that we can find the people who drink tea by adding those who drink only tea to those who drink both: 60 people. We can also see that those who drink neither are those not contained in the any of the three other groupings, so we can count those by subtracting from the cardinality of the universal set, 200. people who drink neither.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U. There are two overlapping circles inside. One is labeled coffee and contains the number 80. The other is labeled tea and contains the number 20. The intersection of the two circles contains the number 40.      The next example illustrates again how to deal with overlapping counts and develops an important counting formula.   Suppose a survey asks participants Which online services have you used in the last month? and offers a choice of   Twitter,    Facebook,    Have used both.   The results show 40% of those surveyed have used Twitter, 70% have used Facebook, and 20% have used both. How many people have used either Twitter or Facebook? How many people have used neither?  Let be the set of all people who have used Twitter, and be the set of all people who have used Facebook. Notice that and . It is tempting to simply add these two numbers together to compute the size of , but this is incorrect because doing so will count those who use both services twice. To correct for this, we can add to and then subtract those in the intersection that have been added twice. That is, Thus, 90% of the people surveyed have used Facebook or Twitter.  To find how many people have not used either service, we want the cardinality of . Since is 100%, and , it follows that , or 10% of those surveyed. These quantities are illustrated in the Venn diagram below.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U. There are two overlapping circles inside. One is labeled F and contains the number 50%. The other is labeled T and contains the number 20%. The intersection of the two circles contains the number 20%.      Inclusion-Exclusion Rule   Let and be two finite sets. Then      mutually exclusive  sets mutually exclusive   Two sets, and , are mutually exclusive if their intersection is empty. That is, , which means that .    A 2-set Venn diagram can be solved for any of the four regions found in such a diagram, as illustrated by the next example.    At a movie theater, 200 people bought popcorn and 150 bought soda. If 90 people bought both popcorn and soda, how many people bought popcorn but no soda?    Let represent the set of people who bought popcorn, and represent the set of people who bought soda. Then we are told that , , and . The number of people who bought popcorn but so soda is the cardinality of . This is the part of the Venn diagram inside of but outside of . Note that That is, 110 people bought popcorn but not soda.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U. There are two overlapping circles inside. One is labeled P and contains the number 110. The other is labeled S and contains the number 60. The intersection of the two circles contains the number 90.        Counting Problems with 3 Sets  Counting problems involving three sets are solved similarly to those involving two sets. The primary difference is that while two sets divide the universal set into four potential regions, three sets divide the universal set into eight total regions as shown in . Computing the cardinality of these regions is thus more complex than for two-set problems and, as we shall see in the following examples, it requires care to tease out correct values without double (or triple!) counting elements. Note that the can be updated for three-set problems, but we do not include the formula here.  To compute cardinality in 3-set counting problems, begin by finding the central intersection where all three sets overlap, if possible. Then, calculate the pairwise intersections where exactly two sets meet. Using these values, determine how many elements belong uniquely to each individual set. Finally, add all these regions together and verify that they match the given total, or use the total to compute any missing values. The following examples demonstrate this approach.    Suppose that fifty students are surveyed and asked if they were taking a science ( ), humanities ( ) or a religion ( ) course next quarter. The results are:   21 were taking a science course,    26 were taking a humanities course,    19 were taking a religion,    9 were taking science and humanities,    7 were taking science and religion,    10 were taking humanities and religion,    3 were taking all three,    7 were taking none of these classes.   How many students are only taking a science course?     To answer this question, it helps to create a Venn diagram that shows all the ways the three sets could overlap. We then work through the given survey results and use them to find the cardinality of each region of the diagram, starting at the center and working outward. When working by hand, we simply fill in the regions with the computed cardinality. However, to help understand the process, in this example we will refer to regions by the letters shown in the provided image.   A 3-set Venn diagram divides the plane into 8 distinct regions, here marked with through .   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U. There are three overlapping circles inside. One is labeled S, one H, and one R. The distinct regions are labeled with lower case letters a through g.      From the given data, we know that there are 3 students in region and 7 students in region . Since 7 students were taking a science and a religion course, we know that . Since we know there are 3 students in region 3, there must be students in region .  Similarly, because there are 10 students taking both humanities and religion, which includes regions and , there must be students in region . With 9 students taking science and humanities courses, there must be students in region .  Finally, we know that 21 students were taking a science course. This includes students from regions , and . Since we know the number of students in all but region , we can determine that . That is, 8 students are only taking a science course.    Note: The above work was directed at finding the number of students who were only taking a science class. However, it is a good idea to solve the 3-set diagram completely if possible. Once this is done, any question about cardinality can be solved quickly. In this case, we can find that , and . The solved diagram is shown here.   The solved 3-set Venn diagram showing the cardinality of each region.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U. There are three overlapping circles inside. One is labeled S, one H, and one R.

In a survey of 75 consumers, 12 indicated they were going to buy a new couch, 18 said they were going to buy a new rug, and 24 said they were going to buy a new sofa. Of these, 6 were going to buy both a couch and a rug, 4 were going to buy a couch and a sofa, and 10 were going to buy a sofa and a rug. One person indicated he was going to buy all three.   How many were going to buy none of these items?    How many were going to buy only a couch?    How many were going to buy only a sofa?    How many were going to buy only a rug?    How many were going to buy a sofa and a rug but not a couch?       Label the sets of people buying couches, fugs, and stoves by , , and . Let denote the universal set.

  "title": "The Multiplication Principle",
  "body": " The Multiplication Principle     Apply the addition rule to counting problem.    Apply the multiplication principle to counting problems.      In the previous section, we explored the art of counting by examining the number of elements in finite sets. Building on that foundation, particularly the inclusion-exclusion principle, we now introduce our first result in this section: the addition rule. Following our discussion on the addition rule, we will further expand our counting techniques by introducing and applying another foundational tool, the multiplication principle.    The Addition Rule  The addition rule is a reformulation of the Inclusion-Exclusion Rule for mutually exclusive sets.   Addition Rule   The addition rule states that if a process can occur in one of two distinct ways, where the first way has possibilities and the second way has possibilities, then the entire process can occur in ways.    Note that the addition rule can be extended to include process or tasks that requires steps. In that case, if there are ways to complete the first step, ways to complete the second and so forth, then there are total ways to complete the task. To see this common-sense counting rule in action, consider the following example.   Using the Addition Rule   You have won a church raffle. The winning ticket entitles you to choose either one of eight possible home-made pies, or one of six types of home-made cakes. In how many ways can you make your choice?    Since you may choose either a pie or a cake, and none of your choices are both a pie and a cake, according to the addition rule you have choices.    The addition rule is useful for counting mutually exclusive cases. For non-mutually exclusive scenarios, use Inclusion-Exclusion Rule .    The Multiplication Rule  Some processes have two or more steps, rather than cases, each of which can happen in several different ways. In order to determine the total number of ways that such a multi-step process can happen, we need to use a new rule, called the multiplication rule .   multiplication rule (counting)  counting rules multiplication   The multiplication rule states that if a tasks consists of two steps where step one can happen in ways and step two can happen in ways, then the entire task can be done in different ways.     Note: The multiplication rule can be expanded to a process which includes stages, the of which can happen in ways, then the total number of ways the task can be done is: .    A college student has two pairs of clean pants and three clean shirts. How many outfits are possible, where an outfit is a pair of pants and a shirt?    Picking an outfit requires two steps:  Choosing a pair of pants from 2 choices,  Choosing a shirt from 3 choices.  Thus, by the multiplication rule the total number of outfits is: .      At a lunch buffet, you can choose from 4 types of sandwiches, 5 types of drinks, and 3 types of desserts. How many different meal combinations can you create by selecting one item from each category?    Selecting a meal requires three steps::  Choosing a sandwich from 4 options,  Choosing a drink from 5 options,  Choosing a dessert from 3 options.  The total number of lunch combinations is thus: .    Both examples above can be represented using a tree diagram . Tree diagrams are helpful tools for visualizing the multiplication rule and solving multi-step problems. They work well when each step in a process leads to a set of possible outcomes. However, when a process involves many steps or numerous options at each stage, tree diagrams can become cumbersome to create and use.   tree diagram   In a tree diagram , each step in a process is represented by a branching point, with each branch showing a possible outcome of that step.      Construct a tree diagram to illustrate the solution to .    Note that the tree has 6 leaves  the number of outfits (outcomes) predicted by the multiplication rule.   Tree diagram illustrating the 6 outcomes possible in ..   A tree diagram with one branch from the starting point for each of of two pairs of pants, and three branches from each pair or pants, one for each clean shirt (1 through 3).       The next example demonstrates that while a tree diagram faithful represents a counting problem that uses the multiplication principle, it can be very large an unwieldy to use!    Construct a tree diagram to illustrate the solution to .    Sixty branches makes this tree inconvenient to use, though it does visually represent all possible lunch options. For problems with many levels or options, the multiplication rule is a more efficient way to solve counting problems.   Tree diagram showing all 60 outcomes possible in .    A tree diagram with one branch from the starting point for each of three sandwich options, and five branches from each sandwich option representing drinks, and three from each drink representing drink choices. This leads to 60 total options, which agrees with the multiplication rule.      Notice that in a tree diagram we represent a particular sequence of choices by following a path through the tree. For example, in the second tree diagram, going along the second branch to sandwich 2, then the first branch to drink 1, and then the third branch to dessert 3 gives us one complete lunch option. The total number of possible lunches is the same as the total number of branches at the last step.  There are some instances where the number of choices we have at a given step depends on the choice we made at the previous step. In these cases, the multiplication rule will not work. However, as shown in the next example, a tree diagram can still be a useful tool for counting the total number of ways to complete such a process.    A travel agency offers a vacation package where you select one destination and one resort. You can choose from three destinations: Hawaii, Florida, and Alaska. In Hawaii, you can stay at either of 2 resorts. In Florida, you can choose from 3 different resorts. In Alaska, only 1 resort is available. How many different vacation packages are possible in total?     This process can be broken up into two steps:  pick a destination (there are three of them);  pick a resort (the number depends on the destination chosen in step 1).     Vacations.   A three with one branch from the starting point for each destination, Hawaii, Florida, and Alaska. Hawaii has two branches for its two resorts, Florida has three branches for its three resorts, and Alaska has one branch.      Since the number of options in Step 2 depends on the choice made in Step 1, we cannot apply the multiplication rule directly. Instead, we use a tree diagram, as shown above. This diagram illustrates how the number of available choices varies based on the selected destination. Notice that there are six branches at the final level of the tree, indicating six distinct vacation package combinations. The tree diagram effectively captures the conditional nature of the choices and helps visualize all possible outcomes.     "

  "body": " Permutations and Combinations     Use Permutations to solve counting problems.    Use Permutations to solve counting problems.      In this section we build on the multiplication principle discussed in the previous section. We start with factorials, which establish the mathematical foundation for the second topic, permutations, which are in turn the building block of combinations. Taken together with the addition and multiplication rule, these three mathematical tools allow us to solve a variety of useful counting problems.    Factorials  The following example shows how the factorial is a special case of the multiplication principle .   Arranging Items   You want to display your four favorite collectibles on your shelf: a Minecraft Steve figure, a Pikachu plush, a Lego Harry Potter minifigure, and a Mario Kart Hot Wheels car. In how many different ways can you arrange them in a row?    This is an example of the multiplication rule using the following steps.  Chose which of the 4 items to place first (4 choices)  Choose which of the 3 remaining items to place 2nd (3 choices)  Choose which of the 2 remaining items to place 3rd (2 choices left)  Choose which of the 1 remaining items to place at the end of the row (only one choice).  Therefore, according to the multiplication rule, the number of orderings is: .    Notice that because we were selecting from our group of items without replacing them, the number of choices went down by one each time. When we use the multiplication rule with this sort of process, we wind up multiplying the numbers between 1 and the original number of choices. This product has a special name.   factorial   For any positive integer , (read  factorial ) is the product of the numbers between and . That is: . Also, by definition,     In the next example we practice computing factorials. Note how quickly the value of a factorial grows as grows. Also, notice that when dividing factorials, canceling is a very useful tool.   Computing Factorials   Find the value of each expression below.         Using the definition above,    .        Six WWU students line up for a photo that will appear in the local paper. The photographer arranges them in a line down the steps of Meske Hall. How many different ways can the student be arranged?    Because each student can only be placed in one position, the number of students decreases with each choice. That is, 6 students can be on the top step, but then only 5 remain to be selected for the second step, 4 for the third step, and so on. Thus, there are possible arrangements.      Permutations  In some counting problems, the process resembles the one used in factorial-based problems, but we are not required to use or arrange all of the items. Here is an example.   Ordering a Subset   Suppose that ten runners compete in a race in which first, second, and third prizes are awarded. In how many ways can these prizes be won?    Using the multiplication rule, the steps in this process are:  Award first prize. Any of the 10 runners could be 1st.  Award second prize. Nine runners could come in 2nd.  Award third prize. Eight runners could come in 3rd.  Thus, prizes can be awarded ways.    While the solution to the above problem started off looking like a factorial, , it stopped after 8 because we didn't need to order the remaining seven runners in this race. In general, when we need to count the number of ways to order or arrange items chosen from possible items, we are using a permutation .    A permutation of a set of elements is an ordered arrangement where each element is used once.     permutation  counting rules permutation   A permutation of n items taken r at a time is used to count the number of ways to arrange (or permute) items chosen from possible items. The formula for this permutation is: .   Note: Scientific calculators have built-in permutation functions. If you're unsure how to use yours or whether to use it instead of the formula above, ask your instructor for guidance.    Applying this formula to the foot-race example above, we could have computed: . Permutations are a general method used to count the number of ways to complete a process when the order of completion matters. A race is a good example of a situation where order is important. Another example is provided below.   Using Permutations   Six bands have expressed interest in performing at a concert, which has time slots for three performances. In how many different ways can the concert manager schedule the performances?    Since there are 6 bands to choose from and only 3 are needed, and because the order of performance matters (changing the order creates a different schedule), the number of possible schedules is: .    There are a few general results that hold no matter what is used in a permutation. Three of these are shown below.     Additionally, the formula shown in algebraically reduces to the following form, , which looks like the multiplication rule. You may find this easier to use than the version written with factorials.    Combinations  Permutations are useful when the order in which we select objects matters as in running a race or creating a schedule. However, order does not always matter. In such cases, we need to change the way we count. This important distinction is illustrated in the following example.   Counting when Order Doesn't Matter   You have two extra movie tickets and want to invite two of your four good friends to join you. In how many different ways can you choose which friends to take to the movies?    Suppose your friends names are: Alice, Bob, Candace, and David. If you try to count the number of ways you could invite two friends using a permutation, you get: . However, this is not the correct answer. To see why, make a list of possible choices that the permutation counts.   Possible selections.    AB  BA  CA  DA    AC  BC  CB  DB    AD  BD  CD  DC     Notice that each pair appears twice. For example, AB and BA are counted separately but these two pairs represent inviting the same group of friends to a movie. This is because in a permutation, the order in which we hand out the tickets makes a difference. But really, we don't care who got the first ticket we just want to know who is going. Since there are two of each possible pairs, the actual number of ways to pick the two friends to go with us is: . The in the denominator is the number of orderings of 2 objects, which needs to be divided out of the permutation because order doesn't matter here.    In the example above, we arrived at the final solution using two steps. First, we counted the number of ways to pick the friends to go with us if the order did matter, in this case it was 12. Then we counted the number of ways that those two friends could be arranged, which was 2. Finally, we divide the 12 ordered ways by the 2 different orderings to get a total of 6 ways to choose our two friends if the order does not matter. This process can be combined into a single counting rule called a combination.   combination  counting rules combination   A combination of n items taken r at a time is used to count the number of ways to choose items from possible items if the order in which we select them does not matter. The formula for this combination is: .   Note: Scientific calculators also have built-in combination functions. Ask your instructor for help finding this if appropriate.    Applying this formula to the movie ticket example, we get: .   Using a Combination   A committee of 10 business executives wishes to form a subcommittee of 3 members to research a strategic initiative. In how many ways can this subcommittee be selected?    The order in which a subcommittee is selected does not matter a person is either on the committee or not on the committee. Therefore, this is a combination and the solution is: .    As with permutations, there are a few general rules that combinations follow no matter what the value of is. Several of these rules are shown below.     The definition of the combination shown above simplifies to a form you may find easier to use: .    Mixed Counting Techniques  One of the most challenging aspects of counting problems is deciding which rules or combinations of rules to apply to a given question. To complicate things further, there are often multiple approaches to reach the correct answer. Here are a few general rules of thumb to keep in mind.   Combining Counting Rules  counting rules combining    If the things you are counting come in two distinct groups, count each group then add together the results. ( addition rule  goes with or )  If there is overlap between the two groups, remember to subtract the intersection. ( inclusion\/exclusion rule )  If the process you are counting can be broken down into steps, count the number of ways each step can be performed and multiply. ( multiplication rule  goes with and )  If you are arranging things or selecting multiple items and the order of selection matters, use a permutation. ( permutation rule ).  If you are selecting multiple items from a group of items and the order in which you pick them does not matter, use a combination. ( combination rule ).     The following examples illustrate these principles. Remember that the first step should always be to identify the rule or rules that should be used to solve a counting problem.   Picking a Counting Rule   The front row of Professor Jackson's classroom has only 4 seats. There are 8 students who wish to sit in these seats. In how many ways can the seats be assigned?    In a seating chart, the order would matter. Therefore, this must a permutation, and the solution is: .     Combining Counting Rules   A committee consists of 6 men and 3 women. Four members of the committee are to be selected for a fact-finding trip. In how many ways can the selection be made if exactly three men and one woman are to be chosen?    The order in which we pick members of a committee to go on a trip does not matter a member either goes on the trip or does not. However, notice that we have two steps to this problem.  Pick the three men to go on the trip.  Pick the one woman to go on the trip.  The number of ways to pick the three men from the 6 male committee members is: . The number of ways to pick the one woman is: . Therefore, by applying the multiplication rule, the total number of ways to select the four people for the trip is: .     Counting by Combining Objects   Trains arrive at a station in random order from Berlin, Munich, Salzberg, Vienna, and Hamburg. In how many ways can the trains arrive so that the train from Berlin arrives immediately after the train from Salzberg?    This problem specifically mentions the order of the trains, so the order will matter. However, we are not asked in how many ways the trains can arrive in general, which would be . Instead, we specify that the Berlin and Salzberg train must arrive one after the other. Symbolically, we want to arrange the following four trains in order: BS, M, V, H. BS is listed together because of the condition mentioned above. We can order these in ways.     Counting Cases with At Least   A deli sells 6 types of salads, 8 types of sandwiches, and 3 types of chips. Picnic baskets are available for purchase and must contain 4 different items selected from these 17. How many different picnic baskets can be made that include at least two different sandwiches?    This is actually the most challenging problem in this section. The reason is that we have to use both the multiplication rule to split the process into steps, and the addition rule to split the process into cases. Here's how we do it:  Case 1 Pick two from 8 sandwiches and 2 from the remaining 9 items .  Case 2 Pick three sandwiches from 8 available and 1 item from remaining 9 .  Case 3 Pick four sandwiches from 8 available and none of the remaining 9 items .  Note that these three cases are mutually exclusive based on the number of sandwiches chosen, and that a picnic basket with at least two sandwiches would fall into one of these cases. So using the addition rule, the total number of picnic baskets is: .     "

Determine the difference between empirical and theoretical probability    Calculate probabilities as the ratio of the number of outcomes in an event to the total number of outcomes possible.      Now that we have learned about sets and counting techniques, we are ready to talk about probability . Probability is something we use in many different ways in everyday life. Consider the following examples.  A weather forecaster predicts that there is a 20% chance of rain tomorrow.  A news cast predicts that the probability a ballot measure will pass is 60%.  The lottery introduces a new scratch ticket in which the odds of winning are 1 in 200.  In each of these cases, we are measuring how likely a certain event is to take place. This is probability.     Probability is the branch of mathematics that studies possible outcomes of events, their relative likelihoods, and how they are distributed.      Theoretical Probability  Probabilities calculated from counting data or simulated results are known as experimental probabilities . In contrast, when the likelihood (or chance) of an event is determined by analyzing all the possible outcomes and calculating the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, it is referred to as a theoretical probability . A third type of probability, called subjective probability , is essentially an educated guess based on personal experience or intuition. This section will primarily focus on theoretical probabilities.   theoretical probability  probability types theoretical   The theoretical probability of a certain event happening in an experiment is found by counting the number of possible outcomes of the experiment in which happens and dividing by the total number of outcomes, assuming each outcome is equally likely. That is:       Basic Probability Rules  Before we can discuss the basic rules of probability, it is important to understand the terminology used. The terms we need to define are rooted in sets , which we discussed earlier in this chapter. First, we need to define what we mean by an experiment in probability theory.    An experiment or trial is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space .    The following example illustrates key terms.   Analyzing a Simple Experiment  A fair coin is flipped twice, and the number of heads is noted. What is the probability that exactly one heads appears in these two flips?  The experiment here is a coin toss. This experiment has the possible outcomes of the coin landing on heads or tails . This set of possible outcomes is called the sample space and typically named . We write the sample space as .  The second set needed is the set containing all of the outcomes from which meet our criterion of having exactly one heads. Any subset of the sample space is called an event . For this problem, the event is .  If we assume that each of the outcomes is equally likely, then (applying ) .    sample space  probability sample space   The sample space for an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.      An experiment consists of rolling two fair die and noting the sum of the numbers rolled. Below are several sets related to this experiment.       Which of these sets is the sample space of the experiment?   the set in (d) gives the possible sums.    event  probability event   An event for a particular experiment is a subset of the sample space for that experiment.    In , the event of interest was . Notice that every outcome in that event is also an outcome in the sample space . This is what it means to say that is a sets subset subset of . Also notice that because is a subset of , it must always be true that contains at most the same number of elements as . That is, . This, together with our definition of theoretical probability , leads to the following rules.   Basic Probability Rules  probability formula basic rules   For any event in a sample space , the following rules must hold.        The first rule says that because is a subset of , the ratio of to can be at most one, and as with any ratio, must be at least 0. The second rule tells us that the probability of something in the sample space happening is 1. Since the sample space contains all possible outcomes, this gives us the maximum possible probability of 1.     An jar contains four red marbles, three blue marbles, two green marbles, and one white marble. A marble is drawn and its color is noted. Find the sample space in this experiment, and assign each outcome a probability.    First, we must find the sample space. There are two ways we could look at this.  We could pretend that we can tell each marble apart, regardless of its color. In that case, the sample space is: .  Since we can't actually tell the marbles of the same color apart, it is more accurate to say that the sample space is: .  The best answer for the sample space is as shown in (2). However, the sample space from (1) can be a good way to answer the second part of the problem.            More Probability Rules  There are other useful probability rules for working with events. The first follows from the inclusion\/exclusion rule that we saw in the previous section.   general addition rule (probability)  probability formula general addition rule   The general addition rule states that if events and are events in a sample space, then: . Note: If and are mutually exclusive this reduces to .     Using the General Addition Rule   A prize machine is filled with 10 yellow erasers, 6 green erasers, 4 red pencil sharpeners, 8 yellow pencil sharpeners, and 5 red bouncy balls. Each prize is inside a plastic sphere, and the spheres are well mixed in the prize machine. Each game will get you just one prize. Determine the probability of   getting a yellow prize.    getting a prize that is yellow or an eraser.    getting a red or yellow prize.          Since yellow is a single event, we just need to know how many prizes there are in total, and how many of the prizes are yellow. The yellow prizes include the 10 yellow erasers and the 8 yellow pencil sharpeners.     To find the probability of getting a prize that is yellow or an eraser, we need to be careful because these are overlapping sets. There are two ways to calculate this. The first way is to add all the items separately, being careful not to double count.     The second way is to apply the general addition rule : add the total of yellow items and the total of erasers, but since the yellow erasers are in both sets, subtract out their joint probability.       For a red or yellow prize, the set of red and the set of yellow do not overlap. They are mutually exclusive sets, so we will add the probability of getting a red prize to the probability of getting a yellow prize.          Note that the general addition rule can be used to find any of the four probabilities it relates. Here is an example where the rule is used to find the probability of the intersection term (the joint probability ).   Using the General Addition Rule to Find an Intersection   A sample space contains events and with , , and . Find .    Using the general addition rule,     The word not often appears in probability problems, and you likely have an instinctive understanding on how to deal with it. For example, suppose you were told there was a 40% chance (probability) of rain. What is the probability that it does not rain? That is right 60%! This is the complement rule and closely related to the idea of the complement of a set , discussed in a previous section.    The complement of an event is the set of outcomes in the sample space that are not in . That is, is the event didn't happen.     An event and its complement divide up the sample space. That is, every element in the sample space is either in the event or in its complement, and never in both. This observation leads to a rule for finding the probability of the complement of an event.   complement rule  probability formula complement rule   The complement rule states that if is an event in a sample space , then the probability of the complement of is: .     Finding the Probability of a Complement   A fair die is rolled and the number that comes up is noted. This results in the sample space . Consider the event  an even number is rolled and  a number greater than 4 is rolled. Find the probabilities of both and and their complements.    The set consists of all even numbers. The complement of , . The probability of each of these sets is . Note that can also be calculated as   The set has probability . The complement of is . The probability of this set is . Again, this agrees with the complement law: .      Probability from Counting  Throughout this section, we have assumed that each outcome is equally likely. In , we pulled colored marbles from a jar in which each marble was equally likely, but not each color. This was because there were more marbles of some colors than others. In that example, we had two different ways to list the sample space, depending on how (or what) we counted. This illustrates how counting is an important tool for computing probabilities.  The definition of theoretical probability shown in is fundamentally based on enumeration (counting). By applying the counting techniques introduced in , we can now address more complex probability problems. In the examples that follow, we will use a variety of counting rules to compute probabilities. Pay close attention to how, in each case, we must first determine which counting rule(s) to apply and how to combine them to count the number of outcomes in both the sample space and the event whose probability we wish to find.   Probability Using Basic Counting Rules   An elderly woman owns 12 cats. She has 3 male tabby cats, 4 female tabby cats, 3 female calico, and 2 male Siamese cats. A single cat is chosen from the herd at random. Find the probability that the cat is:  male  a tabby cat  a male or a calico.      Since we are told the cat is chosen at random, we know that each cat is equally likely to be chosen. Thus, we can use the theoretical probability definition to solve these problems. For each of these events, note that the sample space is all of the cats owned by this woman. Thus, for each problem.  Since we are told that , we compute .  Because , we get .  Finally, , so .      A process in which we choose one item, as we above when we chose a single cat, is often much easier to work with than a process in which we must choose two or more items. Consider the next example.   Probability Using Permutations and Combinations   A special deck of cards contains only 10 cards taken from a standard deck of 52 cards. These 10 cards are the two black aces, two red kings, all four queens, and the two red jacks from the regular deck. Four cards are drawn at random from the deck without replacement. What is the probability that:  none of the cards are aces?  two of the cards are black, and two are red?  at least one of the cards is a queen?  the cards are the queen of hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades in that order?      Notice that nothing is said about the order in which cards are drawn for the first three events. So we will use combinations to count both the sample space and the number of outcomes in these events. The common sample space is found by counting the number of ways to select 4 of the 10 cards if order doesn't matter: .   If none of the cards are aces, then all four are selected from the remaining 8 non-ace cards. This can be done in ways. So, .    We first split the cards into black and red. There are two black aces and two black queens making 4 total black cards. There are two red kings, two red queens, and two red jacks making 6 red cards. Next we must pick 2 of the 4 black cards and 2 of the 6 red cards. This is a multi-step process, so using the multiplication rule: Thus, .     At least one queen means we could have one queen, two queens, three queens, or all four queens. If we try to count this directly, we must count these four separate cases and then use the addition rule to add them together. Instead, let's take a short-cut. The opposite of at least one queen is no queens . If we can find the probability of no queens, then we can use the complement rule to find the probability of at least one queen. If we don't allow the queens to be chosen, there are only 6 cards available. We can pick our entire hand from these 6 cards in ways. So, . Therefore, .   Our last event is different from the other three because the order in which we pick our cards matters. We should therefore use a permutation or the multiplication rule instead of a combination. Keeping in mind that there is only one of each suite's queen in the deck, we compute         Probabilities Using Cases   An experiment consists of randomly selecting three marbles from an jar containing six red marbles, four white marbles, and two green marbles. What is the probability that:  All three marbles are green?  All three marbles are white?  All three marbles are of the same color?      We start by counting the sample space, which will be the same for all three events. We are drawing three marbles from an jar containing 12 total marbles. We don't care about the order in which we draw the marbles, just the colors that are drawn. Therefore, .   Since there are only two green marbles, it is impossible for all three of the marbles we draw to be green. Therefore, .    There are four white marbles. The number of ways we can draw three of the four is . Therefore, .    All three marbles can be the same color by being all green, all white, or all red. We said that and . To determine the probability they are all red, we count . Thus, .  Now since these are three different ways that we can get all three marbles to be the same color, and since each of these events is mutually exclusive (we can't get all three red and all three white), we use the general addition rule to get:         "

  "body": " Conditional Probability and Independent Events     Identify independent and dependent events    Compute and interpret conditional probabilities    Calculate probabilities using tree diagrams, including Bayesian problems.      In the previous section, we explored how calculating probabilities can become more complex when dealing with multiple events. In this section, we turn our attention to how the probability of an event can change when additional information is known. Sometimes, we calculate the probability of an event based solely on the overall sample space. Other times, we calculate the probability of an event given that another event has already occurred. Understanding which approach to use is essential for analyzing dependent and independent events.    Independence  Sometimes knowledge about one event can change the probability of another event. When knowledge about one event happening or not happening changes the probability of another event happening, the events are called dependent . When knowledge about one event makes no difference in the probability of another event happening, the events are called independent .   independent events  probability independence   Two events, and , are called independent if the occurrence of has no influence on the probability of .    Coin flips and die rolls are common examples of independent events flipping heads does not change the probability of flipping heads the next time, nor does rolling a six change the probability that the next roll will be a six. Here is another example illustrating the difference between independent and dependent events.   The events it is raining in New York City and there is a traffic jam in Los Angeles are independent .    The events it is raining in New York City and there is a traffic jam in New York City could be dependent .   Why might rain and a traffic jam be dependent ? Because heavy rain can make driving more difficult, increasing the likelihood of slowdowns or accidents that lead to traffic jams! The following example gives more illustrations of dependent and independent events.     Determine if the pairs of events and described below are independent or dependent.   A coin is flipped three times and  the first flip is a heads while  the last flip is a heads.     A coin is flipped three times and  the first flip is a heads while  all flips are heads.     An jar contains three marbles: 2 red and 1 white. Two marbles are drawn, with replacement.  the first marble is white while  the second marble is white.     An jar contains three marbles: 2 red and 1 white. Two marbles are drawn, without replacement.  the first marble is white while  the second marble is white.           Does knowing if the first flip was a heads or tails change the probability that the third flip will be a heads? Coins do not have memories. Anything we know about the first flip has no effect on what happens on the second flip, so and are independent .    This experiment is different from the previous one. Knowing that the first flip came up a heads does have an effect on whether all three flips come up heads. After all, if did not happen, then can not possibly happen either. Therefore, and are dependent .    Since we are replacing the marbles after we draw them, the probability of getting a red on the first draw and on the second draw are the same: . What happens on the first draw does not effect the probability of getting a red on the second draw. Because of this, and are independent .    In our final question, we are again drawing marbles, but this time what happens on the first draw does make a difference. Since we do not replace the marbles we draw, if does not happen (we draw red), there are two marbles left: 1 red and 1 white. So . However, if does happen (we draw a white), then there are two marbles left, both of which are red. So . Since changes depending on whether happens or not, and are dependent .         Conditional Probability  As we saw above, the probability of one event can change depending on the occurrence of another. Because these probabilities can be different, we need a way to denote the probability of one event given than another has occurred. This is called the conditional probability of the first event, given that the second event happens. The formal definition is given below.   conditional probability  probability conditional   The conditional probability of given is the probability of event given that event has occurred. Symbolically, this is written as .    We read as the probability of given . This simply means the probability of with the extra information that has happened. In we saw several pairs and of events for which having the information that happened changed the probability of . These dependent events provide good examples for computing conditional probabilities.   Computing Conditional Probabilities from Outcomes   A coin is flipped three times. Events and are defined as follows.  : the first flip is a heads  : all three flips are heads    Find the sample space for this experiment, the outcomes in , and the outcomes in . Use this information to find and .    Since the experiment involves flipping a coin three times, a sample outcome would be , representing the first flip coming up heads, the second heads, and the last tails. The set of all outcomes is therefore: .  The first event of interest, , consists of all of the outcomes above resulting in a heads on the first flip. This is: . We can therefore conclude that .  But what about ? The event is: . If we know that has happened, then we automatically know that has happened as well. This is because if all three flips are heads, the first one must have been a heads ( is a subset of ). Therefore, .  Note that and are different! This is equivalent to saying that and are dependent    One good tool for visualizing conditional probability is a Venn Diagram . In the two Venn Diagrams below, we see how the extra information that has happened changes the probability of by, in a sense, redefining the sample space.       A Venn diagram with two circles, A and B. Circle A is shaded a light yellow. Circle B is not shaded.        A Venn diagram with two circles, A and B. Circle A is shaded a light yellow. Circle B is shaded a light pink. The region inside both circles A and B is a mixture of the two colors.       To compute , we ignore and take the ratio of the yellow area in , to the area of the whole box. This is equivalent to saying that   When computing , we know has happened, so we are in the pink area above. To figure out how likely is, we take the ratio of the area in common to and to the area in . This is equivalent to saying that      Conditional Probability Formula  probability formula conditional formula   If and are events in a sample space , then the conditional probability of given is: . Note: you can use unconditioned probabilities or counts to compute conditional probability.    Having multiple ways to understand a challenging concept like conditional probability is helpful. Let's explore another example that uses a table to represent two events and calculate conditional probabilities.   Conditional Probabilities Using the Formula   A hospital conducts a research study on 138 patients who have a history of serious headaches. Several of the patients are given an experimental painkiller, while others are given ordinary Tylenol. Patients are then checked after 45 minutes to see if they are still suffering from headaches. The resulting data is summarized in the table below.

Use the given table to answer the following questions.   Find , the probability the person's headache is gone.    Find , the probability the person's headache is gone given that they took Tylenol.    Are the events H. Gone and Tylenol independent? Explain.       Using the data table we compute the following probabilities.    since 86 of the 138 peoples' headaches were gone after 15 minutes.    To find , we use the conditional probability formula. .    Since the probability of the headache being gone changed when we were told the person took Tylenol, these two events are not independent they are dependent.      Note: When we have tabular data, there is a short-cut to finding conditional probability. Since we are told in (b) that the person took Tylenol, we restrict ourselves to the Tylenol column. Then, the probability that their headache is gone is simply , as above.      General Multiplication Rule  In , we discussed a rule for finding , which we called the general addition rule . We have not yet, however, seen a general rule for finding , the probability that both and occur. Applying a little bit of algebra to the conditional probability formula produces just such a rule. This is called the general multiplication rule because it works in general for any and .   General Multiplication Rule  multiplication rule (probability)  probability formula multiplication rule   If and are events in a sample space , then .      Suppose you have a bag containing 6 red Legos, 4 green Legos, and 3 black Legos. We will make exactly two lego selections from the bag. What is the probability of selecting:   two red Legos in a row if we put the first red Lego back in the bag?    two red Legos in a row if we don't put the first Lego back in the bag?    a red Lego and then a green Lego if we do not put the red Lego back in the bag?          Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of selecting a red Lego is the number of red Legos divided by the total number of Legos, or .  If we replace the red Lego we selected (selections are independent), we go back to having 6 red Legos in the bag of 13 Legos total. Therefore, .    If we do not replace the first red Lego (so selections are dependent), then on our second draw there will only be 5 red Legos remaining, and 12 Legos in total. Therefore, .    The probability of selecting a red Lego on the first draw is the same as in parts a and b. Since we are not putting the red Lego back into the bag, we will have only 12 Lego left in total, of which 4 are green. Therefore, .        Using the General Multiplication Rule   A jar contains 10 marbles: 7 red and 3 white. Two marbles are drawn randomly, one after the other, without replacement. Find the probabilities that:   The second marble is red given that the first marble was red.    The first and second marbles are both red.         Since we are told that the first marble was red, when drawing the second marble we have 9 marbles remaining, 6 of which are red. Thus, the probability the second marble is red is .    The probability that the first marble is red will be since seven of the 10 marbles are red. In (a), we saw that the probability the second marble is red given that the first was red is . Using the general multiplication rule, the probability that the first and second marbles are red is .      In the special case where and are independent , the conditional probability for given is the same as the probability for . That is, . The general multiplication rule then becomes: . In fact, this is one of the best ways to test two events for independence.   Test of Independence  independence (test of)  probability formula independence test   Events and in a sample space are independent if and only if .    The following examples illustrate how to you the test for independence.   Testing for Independence   Two events and in a sample space have probabilities and . Suppose . Are and independent?    We first use the general addition rule to find .   Next, we check using our test of independence. .  Since the above equation is true, and are in fact independent events.      Use the table below to determine whether  ticket and  red car are independent events.   Relationship Between Car Color and Speeding Tickets         Speeding ticket  No speeding ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not red car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665       Apply the test for independence. First, note that . Next, compute . Since these value are not equal, the events ticket and red car are not independent. That is, they are dependent events.      Tree Diagrams and Probability  In a previous section, tree diagrams were useful when working with multi-stage experiments. Since the multiplication rule naturally fits experiments that can be broken up into stages (first happens, then , etc.) it makes sense to look into using a tree diagram again. In fact, doing so provides a useful visualization of conditional probability. This utility is illustrated in the following example.     An jar contains six marbles: 3 blue marbles, 2 red marbles, and 1 white marble. Two marbles are drawn, one after the other, without replacement and their colors are noted. Draw a tree diagram and label the branches with appropriate probabilities for this experiment. Use the tree diagram to find                In the tree diagram below, the labels represent the color of marble drawn. The fractions on the branches represent the probability of drawing that color marble at that stage in the experiment.   Tree Diagram   A tree with three branches off of the start. Branch B has a probability 3\/6, branch R has a probability 2\/6, and branch W has a probability 1\/6. Of of branch B, there are three branches: B with probability 2\/5, R with probability 2\/5, and W with probability 1\/5. Off of the initial branch R, there are also three branches: B with probability 3\/5, R with probably 1\/5, and W with probability 1\/5. Finally, off of the original branch W there are just two branches: B with probability 3\/5 and W with probability 2\/5.     Using this tree diagram, we find the desired probabilities:   Note that can be read right off the tree. Since we are given that the first marble was red, we go across that middle branch. Now, the probability the second is white is the probability on the branch, so .    There are two ways the 2nd marble can be white. If the 1st is red or if the 1st is blue. These are distinct ( mutually exclusive ) paths through the tree. The probability of each is found by multiplying down the branches. Together, their probability is the sum of these two products, giving us: .       Note that the probabilities on the branches of a tree diagram are conditional probabilities. In the example above, the on the bottom branch from to is actually because it connects the event 1st to the event 2nd . The general multiplication rule is then used to find the probability of any path through the tree.   Probability both red:     Probability the first is red and the second blue:     Etc...   Finally, as in the second question in our example, we can find the probability of events such as the second is red by adding together all the different probabilities for paths in which the second marble is red.  The following example utilizes these principles and demonstrates an additional advantage of a tree diagram: the ability compute probabilities when the condition is backwards from the given conditional probability.     According to OHSU's Center for Women's Health, approximately 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men will experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at some point in their lives. https:\/\/www.ohsu.edu\/womens-health\/domestic-violence-more-common-you-might-think Assuming we are only considering heterosexual couples and that men and women are equally represented in the population, answer the following questions:  What is the probability that a randomly selected person experiences IPV?  Given that a person has experienced IPV, what is the probability that the person is a woman?  Given that a person has experienced IPV what is the probability that the person is a man?      While not strictly necessary, drawing a tree diagram will help us find the required probabilities. Let represent the event person is a man , be the event person is a woman , and be the event person has experienced intimate partner violence . In this notation, is the complement of those who have experienced IPV, that is, the people who have no experienced IPV.   Tree Diagram   A tree two branches from the root. The top is labeled M for men, the second W for women. The edge from the root to the M node is labeled 1\/2 as is the edge from the root to the W node. The M node has two children, labeled V and not V. The edges are labeled 1\/7 and 6\/7, respectively. Similarly, the W node has two children labeled V and not V with edges labeled 1\/4 and 3\/4.        Denote the probability that a randomly selected person has experienced IPV by . Notice that either men or woman can experience IPV. That is, composed of either men or woman experiencing IPV. These two mutually exclusive cases are summed by the addition rule , and are show in the tree diagram above as the first and third of the four right-most branches. Multiplying to the end of each branch, . Thus, there is a 19.6% change that a random person has experienced intimate partner violence.    Here we are told that the person has experienced IPV and are wondering what is the chance the person is a woman. That is, we seek At first glance, it may appear that the answer is 1\/4. Be careful: 1\/4 is the probability of IPV given knowledge that the person is a woman, which is . These are different probabilities. The probability we are asked for here, , is not one of the values shown in the tree. However, we can use the tree to find the correct value.  To do so, apply the conditional probability formula and the answer from part a: . That is, there is a 63.6% chance that a person experiencing IPV is a woman.    Because everyone in our population is either a man or woman, the probability of should be complementary to the . That is, by the complement rule , , which is approximately 36.4%.  Alternatively, we could use the conditional probability formula again along with the answer from part a: . Note that this is the same answer as found using the complement law above.         Bayesian Probability  Tree diagrams provide a powerful visual tool for working with conditional probabilities, particularly when events occur in sequence. In multi-stage experiments, tree diagrams clearly illustrate the probability of outcomes at each stage, given what happened in previous stages. However, as we saw in the last example, sometimes we need to find conditional probabilities that run backwards through the diagram asking about earlier events given later ones. For these situations, we use Bayes' theorem, developed by Thomas Bayes, a British mathematician and Presbyterian minister. The theorem, named in his honor after his death, is presented below for the special case of a sample space containing just two events.   Bayes' Theorem (Special Case)  Bayes' theorem  probability formula Bayes' theorem   If a sample space can be split into mutually exclusive events and , then: .    While this theorem formally states the rule we use to solve problems such as the one above, it is not something you should memorize. Instead, use a tree diagram and the conditional probability formula to solve these problems as we did in . Note that the denominator in Bayes' Theorem is just the sum of all cases that result in event . As shown in the next example, this realization means we can easily solve backwards problems even if they involve more than two events.     Recall from that the tree diagram below gives us the probabilities for an experiment in which two marbles are drawn, without replacement, from an jar containing 3 blue marbles, 2 red marbles, and 1 white marble. Use the tree to help find the probability that the 1st marble was white given that the second is red.   Tree Diagram   A tree with three branches off of the start. Branch B has a probability 3\/6, branch R has a probability 2\/6, and branch W has a probability 1\/6. Of of branch B, there are three branches: B with probability 2\/5, R with probability 2\/5, and W with probability 1\/5. Off of the initial branch R, there are also three branches: B with probability 3\/5, R with probably 1\/5, and W with probability 1\/5. Finally, off of the original branch W there are just two branches: B with probability 3\/5 and W with probability 2\/5.       We wish to find . Unfortunately, our tree diagram is backwards for this computation. The probabilities on the branches are the probability of a particular color on the 2nd marble given that we got a certain color on the first. So, we must resort to the conditional probability formula. .  The numerator of this fraction can be found by multiplying along a single branch in the tree: . To get the denominator, we need to add together the probabilities for all possible ways the last marble can be red. This is: .  Therefore, the desired conditional probability is: .     "

Multiplying to the end of each branch, . Thus, there is a 19.6% change that a random person has experienced intimate partner violence.    Here we are told that the person has experienced IPV and are wondering what is the chance the person is a woman. That is, we seek At first glance, it may appear that the answer is 1\/4. Be careful: 1\/4 is the probability of IPV given knowledge that the person is a woman, which is . These are different probabilities. The probability we are asked for here, , is not one of the values shown in the tree. However, we can use the tree to find the correct value.  To do so, apply the conditional probability formula and the answer from part a: . That is, there is a 63.6% chance that a person experiencing IPV is a woman.    Because everyone in our population is either a man or woman, the probability of should be complementary to the . That is, by the complement rule , , which is approximately 36.4%.  Alternatively, we could use the conditional probability formula again along with the answer from part a: . Note that this is the same answer as found using the complement law above.      "

  "title": "Expected Value",
  "body": " Expected Value     Make a probability model    Calculate the expected value for a probability model    Determine whether a game is fair      Finding the expected value is a useful application of probability. It has many applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and it's a topic that the casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and lotteries may hope most people never learn about!    Probability Models  Before we can compute an expected value, we need to understand what a probability distribution (also called a probability model ) is. The example below will help illustrate this concept and show how a distribution might arise. We will then use this example to introduce and develop the idea of expected value.  Suppose you are commissioned to design a game for the annual College Place Block Party to raise money for the Blue Mountain Humane Society. In your proposed game, players roll a six-sided die. If they roll a 6 on the first try, they win $10. If they roll any other number, they get a second chance. On the second roll, if they roll a 6, they win $3. If they fail to roll a 6 on the second attempt, they lose. With the game design complete, your next task is to determine how much to charge players in order to ensure a profit over the long run.  To make a profit, the organizers need to know how much they will pay in winnings, on average, over the long run and charge more than that amount. In other words, they must charge more than the expected value of the game. To figure out the average winnings, you need to tabulate all the possible outcomes of the game.  One way to do this is with a probability model. A probability model or probability distribution is a table listing all possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities. The outcomes will be the amounts a player can win, and we will calculate the probabilities using what we have learned about theoretical probability.  Here is the probability model for the carnival game. Note that the probabilities in a probability distribution must add to 1.    Outcome ($ won)  Rolling Event  Probability    $10  Roll a 6 on the first roll     $3  Roll not a 6 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll     $0  Roll not a 6 on the first roll and not a 6 on the second roll       Expected Value  Think of the expected value as a weighted average. In the Block Party example above, we could take the average of $10, $3, and $0, but they are not all equally likely. It is much more likely to win $0 than it is to win $10. So, to find the average, we multiply each outcome by the chance it will happen and add the products together. This is the expected value of the game.   Expected Value  To find the expected value of an experiment, multiply each possible outcome by its probability and sum the products.   For the Block Party example we have: This tells us that over the long run, players can expect to win $2.08 per game. This also means that the game organizer will be paying out an average of $2.08 per game. Since the game is intended to be a fundraiser, the organizers need to charge more than $2.08 per game in order to raise money.  If the game organizers charge exactly $2.08 to play, the game is considered a fair game since the expected winnings would be $0. In a fair game, the player isn't expected to win anything, nor is the owner expected to earn anything over the long run. However, if organizers charge the player more than $2.08 to play, they will earn money over the long run.  Suppose you suggest charging $5 to play the game. We can determine the net winnings by subtracting the $5 the player has to pay from their expected winnings. This gives us: This means that, over the long run, players can expect to lose an average of $2.92 per game, while the organizers can expect to fundraise an average of $2.92 per game.    Pick4 is a game by the Oregon Lottery that costs $1 to play. In this game you pick 4 numbers in a specific pattern. If the chosen number matches the winning number exactly, the player receives a big payout. Smaller payouts are possible for other matching conditions. Suppose that the payouts are as follows. Determine the player's expected net winnings.    Prize ($)  Probability    $250     $500     $1000     $1500       The provided table is not quite a complete probability distribution since it is missing one important outcome: when the player loses. In that case the prize is $0. We need to add a line for this. The prize for this missing outcome is $0, and since losing is the complement to winning something , the probability will be:      Adding this information to the table gives a complete probability distribution. Now we can see that players are going to lose more than 99% of the time, so the expected value will be heavily weighted toward winning $0.    Prize ($)  Probability    $250     $500     $1000     $1500     $0  0.9961       Therefore, the player's expected winnings are $2.07, on average, over the long run. To find the expected net winnings, we subtract the cost to play. Since it costs $1 to play,     Assuming the given payouts are correct, this would be one game you would want to play for investment purposes since you can expect to earn $1.07 per game, on average, over the long run. Play a million times, and you just might become a millionaire!    In general, if the expected value of a game is negative, it is not a good idea to play, since in the long run you will lose money. It would be better to play a game with a positive expected value (good luck trying to find one!), although keep in mind that even if the average winnings are positive it could be the case that most people lose money and one very fortunate individual wins a great deal of money.  Not surprisingly, the expected value for casino games is always negative for the player, and therefore positive for the casino. It must be positive for the casino, or they would go out of business! Players just need to keep in mind that when they play a game repeatedly, they should expect to lose money. That is fine so long as you enjoy playing the game and think it is worth the cost, but it would be wrong to expect to come out ahead.  Expected value is not only used to determine the average amount won and lost at casinos and carnivals, it also has applications in business and insurance, just to name a few. Let's look at a couple of those applications.    For 3 months, a coffee shop tracked their morning sales of coffee, between 6am and 10am. The following results were recorded:    Number of cups sold  145  150  155  160  170    Probability  0.15  0.22  0.37  0.19  0.07    How many cups of coffee should they expect to sell each morning?    In this case the table tells us that 15% of the time they sell 145 cups of coffee between 6am and 10am, 22% of the time they sell 150 cups, 37% of the time they sell 155 cups, 19% of the time they sell 160 cups, and 7% of the time they sell 170 cups. Since the highest probability is associated with 155 cups, the expected value should lie somewhat close to this.  To find the expected number of coffees sold, we multiply each number of cups of coffee by its respective probability and then add the products.   This means that over the long run, the coffee shop can expect, on average, to sell around 154 cups of coffee each morning. This is an important tool for businesses since it helps inform them how much stock they should keep on hand.      On average, a 40-year-old man in the US has a 0.242% chance of dying in the next year According to the estimator at . An insurance company charges $275 annually for a life insurance policy that pays a $100,000 death benefit. What is the expected value for the insurance company on this policy?    The first thing we want to do is organize the probabilities and outcomes in a probability distribution table. There are two outcomes either the policy holder dies, and the insurance company pays the benefit, or the policy holder does not die, and they do not pay anything.  The probability of paying the death benefit is equal to the chance of the person dying in the next year, and the probability of paying nothing is equal to the complement of the chance of dying in the next year.    Insurance payout  Probability    $100000     $0     Then we can calculate:     So, the expected payout for the insurance company is $242, but they are charging $275 for the policy. Their net revenue would be     The insurance company is making, on average, $33 per policy per year. It shouldn't be too surprising because there are overhead costs and the insurance company can only afford to offer policies if they, on average, make money on them. But how much money should they make? As a consumer it is important to know about expected value.     "

Without the ability to separate credible data from misleading claims, we risk being misled and making poor decisions. Statistics equips us with the tools to think critically and make informed choices, making it an essential subject to study.  Statistics are often used to lend credibility to arguments. Consider the following examples (Note: I am not suggesting these statements are true!):   4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne chewing gum.    Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.    Condoms are effective 94% of the time.    People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.    Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.    A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.    People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.    There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.    79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.     These claims are all statistical in nature. Some may sound familiar and if not, you have likely encountered similar ones. The examples span a wide range of fields: psychology, health, law, sports, business, and more. Clearly, data and its interpretation permeate nearly every aspect of modern life. However, many of these numbers do not represent careful statistical analysis and can be misleading, pushing you into decisions you might regret. This chapter will help you develop the skills to be a critical consumer of statistical claims.    Populations and samples  Before we begin gathering any data to analyze, we need to identify the population we are studying. The population of a study is the group we want to know something about. The population could be people, auto parts or tomato plants.  If we want to know the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical college student, our population might be all students at Walla Walla University. Or it might be:   All college students in the state of Washington.    All freshman at private colleges in Oregon and Washington.    All students at colleges and universities in west coast states.    All students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.    And so on.     The intended population is sometimes called the target population , since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.   population  statistics population   The population of a study is the complete group the collected data is intended to describe.      A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article. What is the population?    While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.    A parameter is a value (such as a percentage, average, or other measure) that describes a characteristic of an entire population. Since collecting data from every member of a population is often too time-consuming, expensive, or impossible, parameters are usually theoretical quantities that we aim to estimate. For example, the average amount of money spent on textbooks per year by all students Walla Walla University is a parameter.   parameter   A measurement describing some characteristic of a population is called a parameter .    To estimate the parameter, we select a sample , which is a smaller subset of the entire population. It is very important that we choose a representative sample , one that matches the characteristics of the population, to have a good estimate. If we survey 100 students at WWU, those students would be our sample. We will talk about how to choose a representative sample later in this section.   sample   A sample is a sub-collection of subjects drawn from a given population.    To get our data , we would then ask each student in the sample how much they spent on textbooks and record the answers, or raw data . Then we could calculate the average, which is our statistic. A statistic is a descriptive value calculated using data from a sample.   statistic   A measurement describing some characteristic of a sample is called a statistic .      A researcher wants to know how the citizens of Walla Walla feel about a voter initiative. To study this, they go downtown to Land Title Plaza and survey 500 pedestrians. Sixty percent indicate they are supportive of the initiative. Identify the population, parameter, sample and statistic.     Population : While the intended population of this survey is Walla Walla citizens, the effective population is anyone walking through Land Title Plaza. There is no reason to assume that these pedestrians are representative of all Walla Walla citizens. (In fact, many are probably out of town visitors!)   Parameter : The parameter is what we want to know about the population, in this case the percentage of Walla Walla citizens who support the initiative.   Sample : The sample is the subgroup of the population selected. The 500 pedestrians questioned make up the sample, which, again, is probably not representative of the population.   Statistic : The statistic is calculated using the data from the sample. The percentage of people sampled who support the initiative is 60%.      Sampling  Before conducting any survey, we need to clearly identify our target population. Let's say a politician hires you to gauge their support for a potential reelection campaign. Who exactly should you survey?  The obvious answer might be everyone in the district, but that's not very practical. Eligible voters would be better, but what about those who haven't registered yet? Even registered voters don't always show up on election day. This is why many pollsters focus on likely voters instead.  Defining a likely voter isn't straightforward, however, and the challenges don't end there. The following example highlights some of the difficulties that arise in political polling.   In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse The Body Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     That said, one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.   Identifying the population can be tricky, but once we know who we're studying, how do we choose a good sample? We want our sample statistic to accurately estimate the population parameter, which means we need a representative sample. Going back to our political polling example: we wouldn't expect accurate results if we only surveyed Starbucks customers or your TikTok followers groups might not reflect the broader voting population. So how can we select a sample that truly reflects the characteristics of our population?    Sampling Methods   Since it's important to select a sample that accurately represents the population we're studying, we must be careful in how we choose it. This means not only avoiding samples that fail to reflect the population but also guarding against unintentional bias in the way data is collected. To ensure a representative sample, the selection process must be truly random. However, there are several ways to achieve randomness. In this section, we'll explore four methods of random sampling, along with one method that falls short of being random.    Simple Random Sample (SRS)  The simplest way to use randomness to collect a sample is to collect a simple random sample .   sample simple random sample   A simple random sample of size is a sample drawn from a population in such a way that every group of subjects in the population is equally likely to be chosen.     Imagine that each student currently enrolled at Walla Walla University has their ID number written on a slip of paper and placed in a basket. After mixing the slips thoroughly, 100 are randomly selected. This process creates a simple random sample.   In practice, computers are better suited for this kind of task. Still, even a random sample might not perfectly reflect the population. For instance, if we repeatedly select samples of 100 student ID numbers from the basket, some samples might include a slightly higher number of students from one major or class year than others. Some samples might have more first-year students, while others might include more seniors. This natural difference from sample to sample is called sampling variation . When we want to ensure certain groups are represented, we need to use a different sampling method.    Systematic Sample  A systematic sample is particularly useful when the population from which we are sampling is already ordered. Examples of this include products coming off of an assembly line, or cars moving through a sobriety check point.   sample systematic sample   A systematic sample is a random sample collected from an ordered population by randomly choosing one of the first subjects, and then selecting every th subject thereafter.     ASWWU is conducting a survey to find out whether WWU students would prefer different operating hours at the Atlas. To gather responses, student workers stand outside the Caf and survey the third student to exit the building, then every tenth student thereafter.    Systematic Sample: subject #2 selected, then every 5th subject thereafter.   One of the first 5 dots was randomly selected, and then every 5th dot thereafter is selected for the sample.       Stratified Sample  In a stratified sample we group the population by characteristics which we think may make a difference, and then select randomly from each group. For example, we may want to ensure that both men and women are included in a drug study, so we select some men and some women. Or we may wish to ensure that voters of all political leanings are included in an election poll.   sample stratified sample   In a stratified sample , a population is broken into several groups (called strata) and then a simple random sample is collected from each of these groups.     Suppose voter registration data for the state shows that the electorate consists of 39% Democrats, 37% Republicans, and 24% Independents. A political action group wishes to survey 1000 people about a particular initiative. To ensure the sample reflects this composition, a stratified sampling method is used. From a total sample of 1,000 voters, researchers randomly select 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans, and 240 Independents from their respective groups. This approach guarantees that each political affiliation is proportionally represented in the sample.    Stratified Sample: Three subjects are sampled from each stratum   The dots have been divided into six groups, and then two dots are randomly selected from each group to form the sample.       Cluster Sample  The difference between a cluster sample and a stratified sample lies in how the groups are used. In a stratified sample, the population is divided into groups (strata), and a random sample is taken from each group. In contrast, a cluster sample involves dividing the population into clusters, then randomly selecting entire clusters and including all individuals within those clusters in the sample.   sample cluster sample   A cluster sample is taken by dividing the population into several groups (called clusters) and then picking a simple random sample of the clusters. We then sample each individual in the selected clusters.     Your eccentric uncle is convinced there's a government cover-up of UFO sightings. To investigate, he decides to conduct a study. Instead of trying to gather data from all 50 states, he randomly selects 10 states and collects data on every UFO sighting reported in those 10 states. Unfortunately, before he can finish, some mysterious individuals in black SUVs show up and take him away.    Cluster Sample: All Individuals in Three Clusters   The dots have been divided into six groups, and then three of those groups are randomly selected and every dot from the selected groups is added to the sample.       Convenience Sample  If we use a sampling technique that lacks an element of randomness, we risk producing a sample that does not accurately represent the population. One of the simplest yet most problematic methods of data collection is the convenience sample . It's important to note that convenience samples should never be used in statistical analysis, as they often lead to biased and unreliable results.   convenience sample  sample convenience sample   A convenience sample is a sample collected by simply selecting the most convenient members of a population.     A pollster stands outside of Walmart and interviews the first 100 people who agree to speak to them. This is a convenience sample.      Types of Studies  Samples are collected from populations for two main reasons. The first is to conduct an observational study a study based on observations or measurements. These may be solicited , such as in surveys or polls, or unsolicited , like observing how many drivers turn right at a red light despite a no turn on red sign.  The second reason is to perform an experiment , where a treatment is applied to subjects to observe their response. In experiments, isolating the effect of the treatment is crucial to ensure valid results. The following example gives examples of treatments.      A pharmaceutical company tests a new medicine for treating Alzheimer's disease by administering the drug to 50 elderly patients with recent diagnoses. The treatment here is the new drug.    A gym tests out a new weight loss program by enlisting 30 volunteers to try out the program. The treatment here is the new program.    A psychology researcher explores the effect of music on affect by measuring people's mood while listening to different types of music. The music is the treatment.    Suppose a middle school finds that their students are not scoring well on the state's standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if a new curriculum would improve scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and teach a class using the new curriculum. To their delight, they see an improvement in test scores.  The difficulty with the last scenario is that it is not clear whether the new curriculum or the math specialist is responsible for the improvement. This is called confounding and it is the downfall of many experiments, though it is often hidden.       observational study  study types observational   In an observational study specific characteristics are observed and measured, but no attempt is made to change these characteristics.     experiment  study types experiment   In an experiment , some treatment is applied and its effects on the subject are observed.      Statistical Bias  There is no way to correct for biased data, so it is important to carefully plan the entire study and data analysis process in advance. One type of bias, discussed earlier, is sampling or selection bias , which occurs when the sample does not accurately reflect the population. A specific example of this is voluntary response bias , which arises when data is collected only from individuals who choose to participate. This can lead to bias if those who volunteer differ significantly from the general population. Below is a summary of other common sources of bias to consider.    Sampling bias : when the sample is not representative of the population     Voluntary response bias : the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is made up of volunteers     Self-interest study : bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the outcome     Response bias : when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason     Perceived lack of anonymity : when the responder fears giving an honest answer might negatively affect them     Loaded questions : when the question wording influences the responses     Non-response bias : when people refuse to participate in a study or drop out of an experiment, we can no longer be certain that our sample is representative of the population     Sources of bias may be conscious or unconscious. They may be innocent or as intentional as pressuring by a pollster. Here are some examples of the types of bias.      Consider a recent study which found that chewing gum may raise math grades in teenagers. Reuters. Retrieved 5\/27\/25 This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily mean the study was biased, we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    Consider online reviews of products and businesses. Customers tend to leave reviews if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied. While you can look for overall patterns and get useful information, these reviews suffer from voluntary response bias and likely capture more extreme views than the general population.    A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with people of different ethnicities. This study could suffer from response bias. A respondent might give an untruthful answer to not be perceived as racist.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have serious consequences; responses might not be accurate if there is a perceived lack of anonymity and employees fear retribution.    A survey asks, Do you support funding research on alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels? This is an example of a loaded or leading question questions whose wording leads the respondent towards a certain answer.    A poll was conducted by phone with the question, “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?” Fifty percent of the people who were called refused to participate in the survey (Probably because they didn't have the time). It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias.      Loaded questions can occur intentionally by pollsters with an agenda, or accidentally through poor question wording. A related concern is question order, where the order of questions changes the results. Here is an example from a psychology researcher: Swartz, Norbert. Retrieved 5\/27\/2025     My favorite finding is this: we did a study where we asked students, 'How satisfied are you with your life? How often do you have a date?' The two answers were not statistically related - you would conclude that there is no relationship between dating frequency and life satisfaction. But when we reversed the order and asked, 'How often do you have a date? How satisfied are you with your life?' the statistical relationship was a strong one. You would now conclude that there is nothing as important in a student's life as dating frequency.      Margin of Error and Confidence Intervals  Even when a study or experiment has successfully avoided bias and has been well done, there is still an element of variation. If we took 5 different random samples of 100 college students and calculated their average textbook cost, we wouldn't expect to get the exact same average for each sample. This is due to sampling variation. To account for this, researchers publish their margin of error or a confidence interval for their statistics. These numbers describe the precision of the estimate for a certain confidence level.  You've probably heard something like, The candidate has 54 percent of the likely voters, plus or minus three percent. The 3% is called the margin of error , so the true percentage is somewhere between 51% and 57%, with a certain level of confidence. To write this as a confidence interval , we place the numbers in parentheses from smallest to largest, separated by a comma: (51%, 57%).  The most common confidence level is 95%, which means if the poll was conducted repeatedly, and we made a confidence interval each time, we would expect the true percentage, or parameter, to fall within our confidence interval 95 out of 100 times. You can learn more on how to calculate the margin of error for different confidence levels in a statistics class.    Let's say we asked a random sample of 100 students at Walla Walla University and found that they spent an average of $451.32 on books their first year, plus or minus $85.63. Write this as a confidence interval, assuming a 95% confidence level.    If the margin of error was calculated to be plus or minus $85.63, then with a confidence level of 95% we could say that the average amount spent by the population is somewhere between $365.69 and $536.95.  These values are found by computing and   We could also write this as a confidence interval : ($365.69, $536.95).  Now we have come full circle and seen how we can use data from a sample to estimate the parameter we were interested in for our population.     "

  "body": " In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse The Body Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     That said, one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.

Write this as a confidence interval, assuming a 95% confidence level.    If the margin of error was calculated to be plus or minus $85.63, then with a confidence level of 95% we could say that the average amount spent by the population is somewhere between $365.69 and $536.95.  These values are found by computing and   We could also write this as a confidence interval : ($365.69, $536.95).

What is Data?   Once we have collected data from an observational study or an experiment, we need to summarize and present it in a way that will be meaningful to our audience. Raw data is not very useful by itself. In this section we will begin with graphical presentations of data and in the rest of the chapter we will learn about numerical summaries of data.   data   Any collection of measurements or values is referred to collectively as data .    We can understand and classify data better if we first understand the source from which the measurements are taken. Each type of measurement such as height, length of time, or favorite pizza topping, comes from a certain characteristic or property called a variable .   variable   A variable is a single characteristic that is being measured or changed.    In a typical set of data, one or more variables are identified, and the measurements are collected for each of those variables.     A wildlife conservationist wishes to better understand the population of fish that live in a certain lake. To do this, she catches 100 fish and records the species, length, and weight of each fish. What are the variables in this set of data?    The three characteristics measured are: fish species, fish length, and fish weight. These are the variables.      Classification by Number of Variables  One way in which we can classify data is based on the number of variables that are being measured. In this chapter we may look at data sets composed of measurements from one, two, or more variables. These are given the following names.   data univariate  data bivariate  data multivariate   A data set can be named based on the number of variables being measured as follows.    Univariate data contains measurements from a single variable.     Bivariate data contains measurements from two variables. This is sometimes called paired data      Multivariate data contains measurements from three or more variables.       Let's look at an example.     Identify each of the following data sets based on the number of variables being measured.   A wildlife conservationist records the species, length, and weight of 100 fish caught in a certain lake.    To better understand how tall tomato plants grow, you record the height of 40 tomato plants at a local nursery.    The mayor wants to know if the local bond measure will pass in the next election. He asks 250 city residents how old they are, and if they plan to support the measure.    As a part of the admission process, a school requires students to submit their name, phone number, zip code, email address, and expected major.          Multivariate. There are three variables: species, length, and weight.    Univariate. Since there is only one variable, height, this is univariate data.    Bivariate. Collecting age and support for the bond means that there are two variables.    Multivariate. There are five variables in this data set, so it must be multivariate.         Types of Variable  Another way to classify data is based on the types of variables that are being measured. The type of a variable depends on what is being recorded. Consider the following example.   Classifying Variables   The post office, wishing to better understand its customers, decides to collect data from 1000 households in eastern Washington. They mail each household a questionnaire asking the residents to confirm their zip code, list the number of people who live in that household, and give the length of time that they have lived there. What are the variables in this study, and how do the measurements differ?    The three variables in this multivariate set of data are: zip code, number of residents, and length of time in residence. The characteristics of these variables are:   Zip Code  While the values recorded are numbers (i.e. 99324, 49103, 92357, etc) they actually represent categories and not numerical values. Notice that it would make no sense to average or add together two zip codes!    Number of Residents  These values are numbers (i.e. 2 residents, 5 residents, 1 resident, etc) and they do actually represent numerical quantities. Notice that it does make sense to talk about the average number of residents or to perform mathematical operations on these values. Also, note that the values that this variable can take on are all whole numbers.    Length of Residence  The values for this final variable are also numbers (i.e. 1 year, 2 months, and 12 days = 1.2 years). It also makes sense to perform mathematical operation on these values. In contracts to the number or residence data, these values can be decimals or fractions.       The example above illustrates the two main types of variables we will study. One example of the first type is zip code , a variable that yields non-numerical data. The values of such a variable represent categories into which individuals can be grouped, or qualities that the data possess. Such variables are called qualitative .   qualitative variable  variable qualitative   A qualitative variable (also called a categorical variable ) is one that takes on values representing categories or descriptions as opposed to numerical values.    The second type of variable and the one we will focus on most in this chapter includes variables whose values are numerical and can be used in mathematical operations such as addition and division. These values represent a quantity rather than a quality , and are therefore called quantitative variables. Examples of this type from our earlier example include number of residents and length of residence .   quantitative variable  variable quantitative   A quantitative variable is one that takes on numerical values. Unlike a qualitative variable, the values of a quantitative variable can be used in computations.       Graphing Qualitative Data   Data, no matter the type, is not very informative in its raw form. A graph is a powerful way to summarize and display data. However, before a graph can be produced the data needs to be summarized in a table. For qualitative data this summary is called a frequency table.  The following example motivates the need to organize data before it can be understood and will be used throughout this section.     To better understand their customers, a pizza parlor decides to collect a list of favorite pizza toppings. They choose an appropriate sampling technique and gather the following data from 96 customers. What does this data tell you?   Raw Pizza Topping Data    cheese  green peppers  olives  cheese    olives  cheese  cheese  cheese    green peppers  cheese  pepperoni  olives    pineapple  onions  cheese  sausage    onions  anchovies  olives  cheese    green peppers  cheese  cheese  cheese    pineapple  mushrooms  green peppers  pineapple    cheese  green peppers  sausage  cheese    sausage  bacon  bacon  green peppers    cheese  pepperoni  pepperoni  olives    pepperoni  pepperoni  green peppers  pepperoni    olives  olives  olives  green peppers    pepperoni  pepperoni  mushrooms  onions    bacon  sausage  sausage  olives    sausage  green peppers  olives  bacon    sausage  pepperoni  pineapple  olives    mushrooms  bacon  onions  bacon    olives  sausage  mushrooms  cheese    pineapple  bacon  green peppers  pepperoni    olives  pepperoni  pepperoni  pepperoni    sausage  sausage  pepperoni  pepperoni    cheese  bacon  onions  pepperoni    pineapple  olives  cheese  bacon    green peppers  bacon  pepperoni  olives       Without proper organization, this data is difficult to interpret. We need to simplify it to uncover trends and extract meaningful insights.      Frequency Tables  The first step needed to graph qualitative data is is to first summarize it. To do so, we construct what a frequency table .   frequency table   A frequency table is a two-column table used to summarize the distribution of a qualitative (categorical) variable.   The first column lists the distinct categories or values that the variable can take.    The second column shows the frequency, or the number of times each category occurs in the dataset.       To understand how this works, let's use a frequency table to summarize the pizza topping data from our first example.     Construct a frequency table for the pizza topping data seen in the example above . Does this table give you a better picture of the data set?     Steps:   List all of the possible pizza toppings in the first column of our table.    Count the frequency with which each topping appears in the original data .    Check to ensure that the total of our counts adds up to the total number of values in the set of data.   This definitely gives us a clearer picture of the data set. We can now see the number of times each topping was selected as somebody's favorite.   Pizza toppings frequency table      Topping  Frequency    Anchovies  1    Bacon  10    Cheese  17    Green Peppers  11    Mushrooms  4    Olives  15    Onions  5    Pepperoni  17    Pineapple  6    Sausage  10    Total:  96        While a frequency table is useful for summarizing data, it can be hard to gauge how popular categories are relative to each other. For instance, in the previous example, two more customers preferred cheese over olives but is that a significant difference? To better analyze this, we can convert counts into percentages.    relative frequency table   A relative frequency table is a table in which each category is listed together with the ratio of the total values from the data set that fall into that category.    Let's revisit the pizza topping data once again, this time constructing a relative frequency table.     Construct a relative frequency table for the pizza topping data seen in .     Steps:   Start with the frequency table from the previous example.    Divide each category frequency by the grand total (in this case 96).    Check to ensure that the sum is 1. Note that in this case, the extra 0.0002 is a result of rounding error in our four-decimal-place answers.   The relative frequency table allows for a clearer comparison between categories.   Pizza toppings relative frequency table      Topping  Relative Frequency    Anchovies     Bacon     Cheese     Green Peppers     Mushrooms     Olives     Onions     Pepperoni     Pineapple     Sausage     Total:         While these tables are a good step in better displaying our data, we still need to translate this into a picture. We will discuss ways to do that in the next section.    Graphs  One of the most basic ways to graphically represent data collected for a qualitative variable is by using a bar graph . First, create a frequency table. Once this is done, you can use computer software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to quickly construct a bar graph.   Bar Graph  bar graph  graphs bar graph   A bar graph is a type of graph used to display qualitative data, where each category is represented by a separate bar. The height of each bar corresponds to the frequency or count of that category in the data set. The bars are separated by spaces to emphasize that the categories are distinct and can be arranged in any order.    Note that you can also make a bar graph using a relative frequency table. This type of graph is technically called a relative frequency bar graph , but it looks just like a regular bar graph. The only difference is that the vertical scale represents percentages instead of raw frequencies.     Construct a bar graph for the pizza topping data seen in     Based on the frequency table for this data , we get the following bar graph.   Pizza topping bar graph   A bar for each pizza topping with heights corresponding to the to frequency of the topping in our frequency table.       Both bar graphs and relative frequency bar graphs are useful for comparing the number or percentage of values in one category with those in another. However, when the goal is to illustrate how each category contributes to the whole, a pie graph is often more useful. Pie graphs can be created using the same software we previously used to construct bar charts. As an example, let's revisit our pizza toppings scenario one more time.   pie graph  graphs pie graph   A pie graph is a type of graph used to represent qualitative data, where a circle is divided into sectors or wedges, each corresponding to a category. The area of each sector is proportional to the relative frequency of that category in the dataset.       Construct a pie graph for the pizza topping data seen in .    Based on the relative frequency table previously constructed for this data, we get the following pie graph.   Pizza topping pie graph   A circle divided into ten sectors with sizes proportional to the relative frequency of the pizza toppings they represent.     Note that spreadsheet programs often convert relative frequencies into percents when constructing a pie graph.       Graphing Quantitative Data   When we wish to represent quantitative variable graphically we encounter many of the same issues we saw with qualitative data: raw numbers are rarely meaningful on their own. Just as we used frequency tables to summarize qualitative data before creating graphs, we must first organize quantitative data to make it interpretable. As we will see below, most of the time this means grouping the data into intervals before creating a graph.    Summarizing Quantitative Data with Tables  The first step in graphing quantitative data is to find a way to summarize it in a table, just as we used frequency tables for qualitative variables. However, unlike qualitative data, quantitative data doesn't come with ready-made categories to use as table rows. So, before we can build the table, we need to create appropriate groupings for the data.   frequency distribution  frequency distribution class  frequency distribution class width  frequency distribution upper class limit  class width   A frequency distribution is a table constructed to summarize quantitative data. It has the following components:    Class : the range of values taken on by the variable is broken up into sections called classes .     Upper Class Limit : the largest number that belongs to a class is called the upper class limit .     Class Width : the difference between the upper class limit of a given class and the upper class limit of the previous class (or the minimum value in the data set for the first class) is called the class width . This value should be the same for each class.   Once the classes are created, treat them as categories and count how many values fall into each. Then, organize the results in a table with one column for the classes and another for their frequencies.    Remember that although a frequency distribution and a frequency table may look similar, they are used for different types of data. A frequency table is typically used to organize and summarize qualitative (categorical) data like colors, brands, or types. In contrast, a frequency distribution is used for quantitative (numerical) data like heights, weights, or test scores. Creating a frequency distribution requires dividing the range of numerical values into classes or intervals before organizing the data.     Daisy is particularly interested in the height of tomato plants. Over the summer, she collects data from various randomly selected gardens in her hometown. Summarize the heights she recorded (rounded to the nearest tenth of an inch) using a frequency distribution with five classes.   Tomato Plant Heights    11.1  10.1  17.9  16.9  9.3  9.6  14.1  15.2    9.4  14.2  12.7  8.4  13.0  12.2  16.2  12.0    9.7  11.2  8.9  17.4  16.6  9.8  17.0  13.4    10.5  15.3  13.5  12.7  12.8  17.0  12.9  8.6    8.3  13.4  17.3  8.8  8.2  13.3  17.4  12.1    16.1  9.4  10.7  17.0  9.9  13.1  10.4  14.8    17.7  10.2  16.6  8.1  8.5  16.9  14.1  17.5    9.1  13.0  8.7  16.0  16.6  14.6  14.8  15.1        To construct a frequency distribution, we follow these steps:   Determine the class width as follows:   Find the difference between the highest number, 17.9, and the lowest, 8.1. We round to a range of 10.    Find the class width by taking dividing the range by the number of classes: .       Starting with our minimum value (we'll round down to 8), add the class width to get the upper class limits: 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.    List the classes in the first column of our table. Note that these should not include the previous class upper class limit, thus the second class is from 10.1 12, not 10 12.    Finally, count the number of values that fall into each class. For example, there are 7 values bigger than 10, but less than or equal to 12.      Frequency distribution of tomato plant heights      Classes  Frequency    8.1 10  17    10.1 12  7    12.1 14  14    14.1 16  10    16.1 18  16        Once we have summarized our data in a frequency distribution, we construct a relative frequency distribution by dividing each class frequency by the grand total. We can also create a representative graph called a histogram , which we will explore in the next section.    Histograms  The graph that we use to describe data summarized by a frequency distribution called a histogram . A histogram is very similar to the bar graphs we used to summarize data from a frequency table. There are, however, some important differences.   histogram  graphs histogram  graphs histogram histogram   A histogram is a graph that displays the frequency distribution of quantitative data using adjacent bars. Each bar represents a class, and its height corresponds to the class's frequency. The bars are ordered by class and must touch to reflect the continuous nature of the data.    In a histogram, the order of the bars is important because the classes are arranged from the smallest to the largest values. The bars touch each other to show that the classes are contiguous, meaning there are no gaps between them. These two features (ordered classes and touching bars) are not present when making bar graphs. Now, let's construct a histogram for the tomato plant heights from the previous example using a spreadsheet, just as we did when creating a bar graph.     Construct a histogram for the frequency distribution found in .    Based on the frequency distribution built in the previous example, we construct the following histogram.   Tomato plant heights   One bar for each range of tomato plant heights arranged in order of increasing height with no gaps between the bars and the height of the bar equal to the number of plants in the range the bar represents.     Notice that the bars in this graph touch each other, and that they are in order from lowest values (between 8.1 and 10) up to highest values (between 16.1 and 18). These are both important characteristics for histograms!      Stem-and-Leaf Plots  One disadvantage of summarizing quantitative data using a frequency distribution or histogram is that you lose the specific data values. In other words, you can no longer see the individual values that existed before the summary. If we want a visual representation of quantitative data that also displays the raw values, we need a different type of graph.   Recovering Data from a Frequency Distribution   Using the frequency distribution created in , determine how many tomato plants are exactly 14.2 inches tall.    Looking just at the frequency distribution we created for this data, this is not possible. If all we have is the frequency distribution, we can only tell that there are 10 plants between 14.1 and 16 inches tall. Some of those may be 14.2 inches tall, but there is no way of knowing without going back to the raw data.     stem-and-leaf plot  graphs stem-and-leaf plot   A stem-and-leaf plot is a table where each data value is split into two parts: the stem (all but the right-most digit) and the leaf (the right-most digit). The table includes a row for each stem, with the stem in the first column and a list of its corresponding leaves in the second column, arranged in ascending order without spaces or commas.    Stem-and-leaf plots are typically created by hand, making them most useful for relatively small data sets when we want a quick visual impression of the data's shape. To ensure accuracy, each \"leaf\" should take up the same amount of space. If you're typing a stem-and-leaf plot on a computer, use a monospaced font like Courier so that narrower digits (like 1) don’t take up less space than wider ones (like 8). Consider the following example.     The following is a list of number of quarter credits taken by 30 different college students. Construct a stem-and-leaf plot for this data.   Number of Credits Taken    12  17  14  13  16  16  18  8  21  16    14  13  16  17  16  16  9  3  18  15    15  12  11  15  21  16  15  6  15  19        Construct a stem-and-leaf plot as follows:   Divide each value into the stem (10's digit) and leaf (1's digit). This gives stems 0, 1, and 2.    List the stems in order in the first column of our table.    For each stem, list the associated leaves in ascending order.      Stem-and-Leaf Plot   Stem | Leaf -----|------------- 0 | 3689 1 | 122334455555666666677889 2 | 11      Notice that the shape of the stem-and-leaf plot in the example above is like a histogram tilted on its side. However, in this particular instance the middle stem seems to have a disproportionate number of leaves, which makes the plot not very insightful. To remedy this, we can split our stems up into smaller pieces.   expanded stem-and-leaf plot  graphs expanded stem-and-leaf plot   An expanded stem-and-leaf plot includes more than one row for each stem. The leaves are divided equally between the rows representing the associated stems.       Construct an expanded stem-and-leaf plot for the credits data from using two rows per stem.     This is done in almost exactly the same way as our last example . The only difference is that each stem gets two rows. The leaves are then split up with 0 4 going in the first row and 5 9 in the second row for a given stem. The result is shown to the right.   Expanded stem-and-leaf plot   Stem | Leaf -----|------------- 0 | 3 0 | 689 1 | 1223344 1 | 55555666666677889 2 | 11 2 |    This gives us a clearer picture of how the credit hour values are distributed!       Interpreting Graphs  The reason we create graphs in the first place is to help us better understand a set of data. So, it's important that we know how to interpret the graphs we create. In this class, we'll spend most of our time working with univariate quantitative variables. That means we need to be sure we know how to interpret histograms. There are three major things to look for in a histogram: does the histogram have a center , does it have one or more modes , and is it symmetric or skewed ?   histogram center   The center of a histogram is the class that most accurately describes the typical value in the data set being described.     histogram mode  histogram unimodal  histogram bimodal  histogram multimodal  histogram uniform One way to describe the shape of a histogram is based on the number and location of its modes . A mode is a class that contains significantly more data than the classes immediately next to it. A histogram can be unimodal (one mode), bimodal (two modes), multimodal (more than two modes), or it may have no prominent modes in which case it is called uniform .   histogram symmetric  histogram skewed Another way to describe the shape of a histogram is by its symmetry . A histogram is symmetric when the left and right sides are mirror images of each other. It is skewed right if the right tail extends farther than the left, and skewed left if the left tail extends farther than the right.  We can tell a lot about the distribution of values of a single quantitative variable by describing the histogram in these terms. Consider the following example.     Locate the center of each histogram and then classify it by number of modes and symmetry.   Various Histograms to Classify       Histogram bars increase from left to right with until the next-to-last bar, which is the highest. The last bar is somewhat lower.        Histogram bars increase from left to right for the first three bars. The fourth bar is significantly lower, and then the last bar is about the same height as the third.          Histogram bars increase from left to right until the third bar, which is the highest. Then they decrease at about the same rate at which they increased.        Histogram bars are at about the same height all the way across, with the second bar a little higher and the fourth a little lower than the rest.          The left most histogram bar is short, the second is quite tall, the third is short again (but a little taller than the first), the fourt is tall again (and a little taller than the second) and the last one is between the second and third in height.        The first bar is quite tall, the second is very short, the third is tall again (a little taller than the first) and the fourth is short (a little shorter than the second). The last bar is almost as tall as the first.             This histogram has a single mode in the 15.1 20 class. The histogram is skewed to the left (that tail is longer) and the center appears to be somewhere between the 10.1 15 class and the 15.1 20 class.    Histogram (b) has two modes (bimodal). It is also skewed to the left, and the center appears to be again between the 10.1 15 and 15.1 20 classes.    This histogram is unimodal and symmetric. The center is in the 10.1 15 class.    Histogram (d) does not appear to have any modes while some of the bars are taller than their neighbors, the difference is very small. We will call this histogram uniform and symmetric with the center right in the middle class, 10.1 15.    This histogram is bimodal and appears to be slightly skewed to the left. The center appears to be in the middle class.    The final histogram is multimodal (three modes) and symmetric. The center is in the middle class, 10.1 15.        "

What are the variables in this study, and how do the measurements differ?    The three variables in this multivariate set of data are: zip code, number of residents, and length of time in residence. The characteristics of these variables are:   Zip Code  While the values recorded are numbers (i.e. 99324, 49103, 92357, etc) they actually represent categories and not numerical values. Notice that it would make no sense to average or add together two zip codes!    Number of Residents  These values are numbers (i.e. 2 residents, 5 residents, 1 resident, etc) and they do actually represent numerical quantities. Notice that it does make sense to talk about the average number of residents or to perform mathematical operations on these values. Also, note that the values that this variable can take on are all whole numbers.    Length of Residence  The values for this final variable are also numbers (i.e. 1 year, 2 months, and 12 days = 1.2 years). It also makes sense to perform mathematical operation on these values. In contracts to the number or residence data, these values can be decimals or fractions.      "

In addition to graphical and verbal descriptions, we can use numerical summaries to better understand quantitative distributions by examining where the data is centered and how spread out the values are. Together, measures of center and spread provide important information for estimating population parameters. This section focuses on measures of center, while the next will address measures of spread. We will begin by exploring three common ways to describe the center of a distribution: the mode, median, and mean, each suited to different situations.    Mode  We have already seen the term mode used in the context of a graph. Recall that the mode of a histogram or bar graph is the class or category that has the tallest bar. That is, it is the class or category that appears the most in the data set. This seems to be a reasonable way to describe a typical element of a data set and leads to the following definition.   mode  measures of center mode   The mode of a set of values is the value that appears most often. If more than one value is tied for the most appearances, each one is a mode. If no value appears more than once, there is no mode.    The mode is unique among our measures of center as it is the only one that applies to both quantitative variables and qualitative variables . Consider the following examples.     A breakout presentation at a business convention attracts 16 participants. The job title of each of these participants is as follows. Find the mode of this set of data.   Job titles    manager  owner  H.R. director  owner    manager  H.R. director  manager  manager    owner  manager  manager  H.R. director    manager  owner  owner  manager       The mode is the most commonly appearing value. One way to find that is to construct a frequency table . Doing so for this data produces the following table, from which we can see that the mode is manager .   Frequency Table    Value  Frequency    manager  8    H.R. director  3    owner  5          A survey of twelve grocery store shoppers asked how many times a month these shoppers visit their favorite grocery store. Find the mode of the resulting data, shown below.   Number of visits per month    6  2  5  1  3  5  3  2    7  4  1  5  3  6  4  8       Again, the best starting point is to construct a quick frequency table.   Frequency Table    Value  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8    Frequency  2  2  3  2  3  2  1  1     Notice that in this data set, both the 5 and the 3 appear three times. Every other value appears two or fewer times. This makes this set of data bimodal with modes 3 and 5.    While the mode is an easy way to measure the center, and is in fact the only way we have to measure the center of a set of qualitative data, it is usually not the best choice for measuring the center of a set of quantitative data. To see why this may be so, consider the next example.    Find the mode of the following sets of numbers.        The modes of these sets of numbers are as follows:   This data set contains no repeated values. Therefore, according to the definition , there is no mode for this set.    This data contains only one repeated value, the 1. So the mode is 1. However, 1 is definitely not the typical value in the set since all other values are between 19 and 32.       In summary, you should use the mode to measure the center of any qualitative set of data, or as a quick, but not definitive, measure of center for quantitative data. But be careful! The mode may not exist, there may be multiple modes, and if there is a single mode it may be very different from the typical values in the data set.    Midrange  When we think of the typical value in a set of data, we may also think of the word middle . Our next measure of center, the midrange , is exactly that the middle of the data set. Note that the midrange is not a very useful measure of center. Rather, we introduce it in order to discuss outliers and why some measures of center are more appropriate than others depending on characteristics of the data.   midrange  measures of center midrange   The midrange of a set of data is the value in the exact center of the data. To compute the midrange, use the formula: where maximum is the maximum value in the data set and minimum is the minimum value.      A certain pond has been well stocked with fish for the upcoming fishing season. In order to keep a fish from this pond, it must be at least 13 inches long. To try to determine if the fish in the pond are long enough to allow fishing, a fish and game warden randomly catches and releases 20 different fish, finding the following lengths, in inches. Find the midrange of these data.   Fish lengths in inches    13.2  10.8  14.6  17.2  17    18.3  6.5  13.4  16.7  11.3    12.3  9.8  9.4  11.6  12.1    8.7  12.6  13  14.3  13.1       To find the midrange we need to identify the maximum and minimum values in the data set. The largest value is 18.3 and the smallest is 6.5, Thus we compute the midrange using: . It looks like the pond is not yet ready to open for fishing. The typical fish, as measured by the midrange, is only 12.4 inches long and could not be kept.    The midrange is useful for measuring the center of a dataset, but it has significant limitations. Most importantly, the midrange is extremely sensitive to outliers . Additionally, it only considers the maximum and minimum values, ignoring all other data points. Ideally, a measure of center should incorporate every value in the dataset when determining the typical value.   outlier   An outlier in a data set is a value that is either much larger than the rest of the data or much smaller than the rest of the data.    To see how an outlier can affect the midrange, let's take another look at the fish-length data from the previous example.     The game warden believes that the 6.5 inch fish she caught in the sample above is an outlier. She decides to redo the computation without that fish. Find the new midrange.    Without the 6.5 inch outlier, the new minimum is 8.7. This gives the following values: . With this new computation, it looks like the fish are in fact large enough to be caught the typical fish length, as measured by the midrange, is 13.5 inches.    Notice what a big difference the single 6.5 inch fish made! This is what we mean when we say that the midrange is sensitive to outliers.    Median  To reinforce why we need a measure of center that is resistant to outliers, consider the following example.   The most expensive house in a certain market is a $2,500,000.00 mansion. The least expensive house is an $8,000.00 mobile home. Do you think that the midrange is an accurate measure of the typical home value in this market?  To answer this question, let's first compute the midrange. This is: Do you think that the typical house really costs one and a quarter million dollars? Probably not! The midrange is not an appropriate measure of center for this data.   As we saw before, the outliers in this data set are affecting the midrange. To address these limitations, we need a measure of center that is resistant to outliers and uses more than just the extreme values.   median  measures of center median   The median of a data set is the middle number, or average of the two middle numbers, in the set of data once it has been arranged in increasing order.    You may have heard of the median , a common measure of center that's especially useful when a data set includes outliers, such as housing prices or household incomes. The term median household income is often used because it reflects typical earnings more accurately in such cases. This is especially helpful in places like Washington State, where billionaires like Bill Gates can skew the data. Let's practice finding the median.     Find the median of each set of data below.                To find the median, first arrange the data values from least to greatest, then locate the middle value. Let's apply this process to both data sets above.   Our first step is to re-arrange this set of numbers in order, from smallest to largest: Then we find the middle number. Since there are an even number of values (ten of them), the exact middle lies half way between the two center values (5th and 6th) which are 13 and 14. So the median is .    Again, we start by ordering the data: As there are an odd number of values in this data set (seven of them), the median is the single value in the exact center (the 4th value), which is 178.       Notice that the 1000 in the second data set is an outlier. But when finding the median, the actual value doesn't matter only its position in the data set does. You could replace 1000 with a more typical number like 220, and the median would stay the same. Bill Gates could earn just $200,000 a year, and the median household income in Washington State wouldn't change! This is what it means for the median to be resistant to outliers .    Mean  While the median effectively handles outliers, it has one significant limitation: it ignores the values of individual data points. When we want each value to influence our measure of center, we use the arithmetic mean (commonly called the average). Unlike the median, the arithmetic mean incorporates every data point in the dataset. For a sample, we use (read x bar ) to represent the mean.   mean  measures of center mean   The arithmetic mean , which we will call simply the mean , is a measure of center found by taking the sum of all values in the data set and dividing by the number of values in the data set. Symbolically, , where is the number of values in the data set.    The term arithmetic mean is important for two reasons. First, we avoid calling it the average because average simply means typical, and there are multiple ways to measure what's typical. Second, we specify arithmetic mean because other types of means exist, though we don't cover them here.    Mirabel's exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, and 94. What is her mean test score?    To find the mean test score we need to find the sum of her test scores, then divide the sum by the number of test scores ( ). The mean is:     Notice that the mean has the same units as the data and that it is important to label it.    It is reasonable to calculate the mean by hand when working with a small data set. However, if the data set is large or if you plan to compute additional statistics, using technology is a more efficient choice. Ask your instructor how to approach these types of problems. That said, when a large data set with repeated values is organized in a frequency table, it can still be practical to perform the calculation by hand as shown in the next example.    One hundred families from a particular neighborhood are randomly selected and asked to give their annual household income rounded to the nearest $5,000. The results are shown in the frequency table below. Find the mean annual income for this neighborhood.    Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency    $15  6    $20  8    $25  11    $30  17    $35  19    $40  20    $45  12    $50  7      Calculating the mean by hand could get tedious if we try to type in all 100 values:   However, we can calculate this easily using multiplication top deal with repeated values. Doing so, the sum of the data values (the numerator of the mean) is . The mean is then That is, the mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars or $33,900.      Which Measure Should I Use?  We have now seen four different numerical measures of center:   the mode ,    the midrange ,    the median , and    the mean .   How do we know when to use a particular measure of center? To better answer this question, let's review the strengths and weaknesses of each of these numerical summaries.   Comparison of measures of center          Qualitative  Quantitative  Sensitive  Considers     Data  Data  to Outliers  every Value    Mode  sometimes  sometimes  no  no    Midrange  no  yes  yes  no    Median  no  yes  no  no    Mean  no  yes  somewhat  yes     As we can see, each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Based on these, we summarize when to use which measures of center below.      Mode  Use the mode when dealing with qualitative data, or for a quick measure of center for small sets of quantitative data. The mode may not exist, and should not be used in general for larger sets of quantitative data.    Midrange  The midrange may be used for a quick estimate of center and variation, but should not be used if there are any indications of outliers.    Median  Use the median if there are indications of strong outliers in your data. Data sets which with strong outliers would include income or housing price data.    Mean  The mean is the best all-purpose measures of center and variation for quantitative data. Unless your data set has strong outliers, this is the summary value you should use.         Determine which measure of center would be best in each of the following data sets.   The salaries of all employee's at IBM.    A quick assessment of how well a group of athletes did in a 100-meter dash.    Determine the typical hair color in a group of teenagers.    Finding the typical height of a pine tree in a given acre of forest.          Salaries of all employees at a large firm such as IBM are likely to include outliers, such as the CEO's salary. For this reason, the median is probably the best measure of center.    The midrange may be best. This set of data should not include many outliers, and the values will be small and relatively close together. This makes the midrange an acceptable way to quickly measure the center.    Hair color is a qualitative variable, so our only choice is to use the mode.    Pine tree heights on an acre of forest land should not have large outliers, and there are likely to be quite a few trees. Since there is no reason to use any of the other measures of center, the mean would be best here.       It is often helpful to compute multiple summary statistics for comparison. One useful comparison is between the mean and the median. If the mean is greater than the median, the data distribution is typically skewed right . If the mean is less than the median, the distribution is skewed left . When the mean and median are approximately equal, the distribution is roughly symmetric .    Recent college graduates were asked how much student loan debt they have. The data has a mean of $46,265 and a median of $33,652. Based on this information, do you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right?    Since the mean is greater than the median, we expect the distribution to be skewed to the right.     "

Mean  The mean is the best all-purpose measures of center and variation for quantitative data. Unless your data set has strong outliers, this is the summary value you should use.     "

Hair color is a qualitative variable, so our only choice is to use the mode.    Pine tree heights on an acre of forest land should not have large outliers, and there are likely to be quite a few trees. Since there is no reason to use any of the other measures of center, the mean would be best here.      "

  "body": " Measures of Dispersion     Calculate and describe the measures of variation including range, standard deviation, and interquartile range (IQR).      A measure of center such as the mean is not sufficient to numerically summarize the characteristics of a data set. To see why this is the case, consider the following three sets of quiz scores for a 10-point quiz.   Section A:     5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5     Section B:     0  0  0  0  0  10  10  10  10  10     Section C:     4  4  4  5  5  5  5  6  6  6    Notice that all three data sets have a mean of 5 points and median of 5 points, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different from each other. In Section A, everyone had the same score; in Section B half the class earned no points and the other half got a perfect score. The scores for Section C are less consistent than the other sections but grouped closer to the central score of 5.  Thus, in addition the measures of center, we also need a measure of how spread out (or varied , or dispersed ) each data set is in order to characterize it well. There are several ways to measure the variation of a distribution. In this section we will look at the range , interquartile range (IQR) , and standard deviation .    Range  The simplest ways to quantify the spread of a data set is to compute the range . The range tells us the width of the entire data set by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum value.   range  measures of spread range   The range of a set of data is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set. That is: .    While simple to compute, the range is not a very useful measure of variation because it is heavily influenced by extreme values, or outliers . For example, consider the distribution of full-time salaries in the United States. While many people earn near minimum wage, a few individuals such as CEOs of major corporations earn millions or even billions of dollars. This creates an enormous range that reveals little about where most salaries actually fall or how they are distributed around the typical ( center ) value.    A certain pond has been well stocked with fish for the upcoming fishing season. In order to keep a fish from this pond, it must be at least 13 inches long. To try to determine if the fish in the pond are long enough to allow fishing, a fish and game warden randomly catches and releases 20 different fish, finding the following lengths, in inches. Find the range of these data.   Fish lengths in inches    13.2  10.8  14.6  17.2  17    18.3  6.5  13.4  16.7  11.3    12.3  9.8  9.4  11.6  12.1    8.7  12.6  13  14.3  13.1       To find the range we need to identify the maximum and minimum values in the data set. The largest value is 18.3 and the smallest is 6.5, Thus the range is: . That is, the range in observed fish lengths is 11.8 inches.      Interquartile Range (IQR)  Recall from the previous section that the median is the most outlier-resistant measure of center. To create a similarly resistant measure of variation, we can extend the logic used to create the median. The median divides data into two halves. If we further divide each half at its median, we create four quarters ( quartiles ). The interquartile range (IQR) measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data by finding the distance between the first quartile ( ) and third quartile ( ). Since the IQR excludes the extreme 25% of data on each end, it remains unaffected by outliers.   quartiles  measures of relative standing quartiles   Quantitative data can be divided up into quarters using five quartiles . These are:   the zeroth quartile ( ), which is the minimum value in the data set.    the first quartile ( ), which divides the bottom quarter of the data from the rest of the data.    the second quartile ( ), which divides the bottom half of the data from the top half. This is more commonly called the median.    the third quartile ( ), which divides the bottom three-quarters of the data from the top quarter.    the fourth quartile ( ), is the maximum value in the data set.        interquartile range (IQR)  measures of spread interquartile range (IQR)   The Interquartile Range or IQR is the difference between the 3rd and 1st quartiles. That is, .    Note that there are different methods for computing quartiles, so your results may vary when using spreadsheets or computer algebra systems. The following examples demonstrate how we will compute and in this course. If you obtain different values using technology, consult your instructor.    Suppose we have measured the height, in inches, of 12 women. The data values are listed below. Find the interquartile range.    59  60  69  64  70  72  66  64  67  66  63  61      First, order the data.    59  60  61  63  64  64  66  66  67  69  70  72    Next, divide the data into two halves. In the case of an even sample size, we split the distribution down the middle. The first 6 data values are the lower half and the next 6 data values are the upper half. Then we find the median of each half. The median of the lower half is and the median of the upper half is .     In this data inches, and inches. The IQR is thus This tells us the that the middle 50% of the women's heights lie within an interval of 6 inches centered around the median height of 65 inches. Said another way, 50% of the heights fall between 62 and 68 inches.      Suppose we added one more height (68 inches) to the data set from the previous example. Find the interquartile range of the heights.    59  60  61  63  64  64  66  66  67  68  69  70  72      The data are already in order, but now we have an odd number of values. We use the median value of 66 as both the maximum value for the lower half of the data and the minimum value for upper half. The interquartile range is then . That is, the middle 50% of the women's heights lie within an interval of 5 inches centered around the median value of 66 inches. That is, 50% of the heights are between 63 and 68 inches.      Standard Deviation  While the interquartile range is a good measure of spread, sometimes there are no outliers in a data set, or a measure of spread that takes all values into account is desirable. In this case, the standard deviation is used to describe variation. The sample standard deviation , denoted , is a measure of variation that tells us how far, on average, the data values deviate from the mean.   standard deviation  measures of spread standard deviation   The sample standard deviation , is the average distance of a data point from the mean of a data set. That is, , where is the sample size.    The following example illustrates the whole process for calculating the standard deviation and is provided to help you understand how to compute the standard deviation.   Returning to the quiz example used in the introduction of this section as motivation, let's suppose there is a fourth set of of quiz scores for a 10-point quiz. The mean quiz score for Section D, like Sections A, B and C, is 5 points.   Section D:     0  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  10    The first step in finding the standard deviation is to find the deviation, or difference, of each data value from the mean. We will do this in a table. You could also use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.    Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value Mean)    0     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     10     We want to find the average deviation from the mean, but if we find the average of the values in the second column, the negative and positive values cancel each other out (this will always happen), so to prevent this we square the deviations to make them all positive.    Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value Mean)  Deviation Squared    0      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      10      Next, we add the squared deviations and we get Ordinarily, when computing an average (mean) we would then divide this total by the number of scores, , (in this case, 10) to find the mean of the deviations, but the division by is only done if the data set represents a population. When the data set represents a sample (as it almost always does), we divide by (in this case,).  To find the mean of the deviations, we would typically divide this total (50) by the number of scores, (in this case, 10). However, we divide by only when the data represents a population. For sample data (which is more common), we divide by (in this case, 9).  We assume Section D represents a sample, so we will divide by 9. Note that units of are now points-squared because we squared all of the deviations. It is more meaningful to use the units we started with, so we take the square root of this quantity to convert back to points .  Thus, the sample standard deviation for Section D is . This means that, on average, the data in Section D is 2.36 points away from the mean value of 5 points. For comparison, the standard deviations for the other sections are:   points,    points,    points,    points.   Note that this these values show that the data from Section C has the smallest average distance from the mean, meaning these scores are the least spread out. This matches what we observe when we look at the data.   Here are a few important characteristics to keep in mind when finding and interpreting the standard deviation.   The standard deviation is never negative. It will be zero if all the data values are equal and get larger as the data spreads out .    The standard deviation has the same units as the original data and it is important to label it.    The standard deviation, like the mean, can be influenced by outliers.      Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation     Find the mean of the data.    Find the deviations by subtracting the mean from each data value.    Square each deviation.    Sum the squared deviations.    Divide the sum of the deviations by and take the square root.        The price of a pint of peanut butter at 5 stores was $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99. Find the sample standard deviation of these data.    First we need to calculate the sample mean: . Keep in mind we divide by here.  Next, we need to find the deviation from the mean for each data value and square it. This is easiest done in a table.    Data Value  Deviation  Deviation Squared    $3.29      $3.59      $3.79      $3.75      $3.99      The sum of the deviations squared is . Therefore, the sample standard deviation is Since the units are dollars, we round to two decimal places. This gives us a standard deviation of $0.26. This means that, on average, the cost of a pint jar of peanut butter in our data set is $0.26 away from the mean value of $3.68.     "
